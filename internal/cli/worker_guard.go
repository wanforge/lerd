// buildWorkerGuard wraps runCmd in a shell snippet that prevents duplicate
// workers on macOS under the podman-exec runtime mode.
//
// Two failure modes are addressed:
//
//  1. Brief podman-machine SSH hiccup. The outer `podman exec` exits but
//     the inner artisan process inside the FPM container survives. The
//     pid-file mutex (step 1) catches the case where launchd respawns
//     before the outer process is gone.
//
//  2. Suspend/wake. The laptop sleeps; on wake the host-side `podman exec`
//     dies (its TCP/vsock link to the machine was torn down) but the inner
//     artisan process inside the container resumed normally. The pid-file
//     mutex doesn't help — its EXIT trap removed the file when the outer
//     process died — so step 2 reaches into the container, finds processes
//     matching the worker command WHOSE WORKING DIR EQUALS THIS SITE'S
//     PATH, and graceful-stops them. Then step 3 launches a fresh one.
//
// Cwd-scoping in step 2 is critical: every Laravel site shares the same
// FPM container and runs identical argv for `php artisan queue:work` /
// `schedule:work` / `horizon`. A naive argv-only pkill would nuke the
// same worker type running in *other* sites. Each site's `podman exec
// -w <sitePath>` sets a unique cwd, so /proc/<pid>/cwd is the disambig.
//
// On launch:
//
//  1. If the pid file exists AND its PID is alive, the previous outer
//     process is still driving the worker — exit 0.
//  2. Otherwise SIGTERM any in-container process matching workerCmd
//     whose cwd is sitePath. Failures are swallowed.
//  3. Record our own PID, install an EXIT trap to clean up, and replace
//     ourselves with runCmd.
//
// Stale pid files (previous process crashed) resolve on their own: the
// kill -0 check in step 1 fails and the new instance takes over.
