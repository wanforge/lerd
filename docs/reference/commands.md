# Command Reference

## Setup & lifecycle

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd install` | One-time setup: directories, network, binaries, DNS, nginx, watcher |
| `lerd start` | Start DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM containers, and all installed services; warns about port conflicts and builds or pulls any missing images first |
| `lerd stop` | Stop DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM containers, and all running services |

| `lerd setup` | Bootstrap a project: runs the lerd init wizard first, then a checkbox list of steps |
| `lerd setup --all` | Run init (or apply saved `.lerd.yaml`) and all steps without prompting (useful in CI) |
| `lerd setup --skip-open` | Same as above but don't open the browser at the end |

Setup steps include common tasks (composer install, npm install, lerd env) plus framework-specific commands defined in the framework's `setup` field (e.g. migrations, storage links). See [Framework definitions](/usage/framework-definitions) for how to define custom setup commands.

## Site management

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd park [dir]` | Register all Laravel projects inside `dir` (defaults to cwd) |
| `lerd unpark [dir]` | Remove a parked directory and unlink all its sites |
| `lerd link [name]` | Register the current directory as a site; prompts to import data when `laravel/sail` is detected in `composer.json`. **Non-PHP projects** (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) must have `Containerfile.lerd` and `.lerd.yaml` with `container: {port: N}` already written before calling this, see [Custom Containers](../usage/custom-containers.md) |
| `lerd link [name] --domain foo.test` | Register with a custom domain |
| `lerd unlink [name]` | Stop serving the site |
| `lerd sites` | Table view of all registered sites |

| `lerd unpause [name]` | Resume a paused site: start container, restore vhost, restart workers |
| `lerd restart [name]` | Restart the container for the current or named site (custom container or PHP-FPM) |
| `lerd rebuild [name]` | Rebuild the custom container image from Containerfile and restart |
| `lerd group add <main> <label>` | Group the current site under `<main>` (name or domain) at `<label>.<main-domain>`; add `--share-db` to share the main's database. See [Site Groups](../usage/site-groups.md) |
| `lerd group label <label>` | Change the current secondary's subdomain label |
| `lerd group db <share\|separate>` | Switch the current secondary between sharing the main's database and keeping its own |
| `lerd group remove` | Ungroup the current secondary, restoring a standalone domain |
| `lerd group list` | List all site groups and their members |
| `lerd env` | Configure `.env` for the current project with lerd service connection settings; backs up the original as `.env.before_lerd` on first run (skipped if lerd has already written to the file) |
| `lerd env:restore` | Restore `.env` from the pre-lerd backup (`.env.before_lerd`) |
| `lerd env:override [KEY=VALUE ...]` | Create/seed a personal, gitignored `.env.lerd_override` whose values win over lerd's defaults on `lerd env`; `LERD_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=` marks services lerd should not start or provision |

## LAN

### LAN sharing (per-site, no DNS setup required on clients)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd lan:share` | Start a LAN reverse proxy for the current site on a stable port; prints the URL and a QR code |
| `lerd lan:unshare` | Stop LAN sharing for the current site and release its port |

The proxy runs inside the lerd daemon (`lerd-ui`), no external tool needed and no internet access required. Any device on the same network can reach the site at `http://<your-LAN-IP>:<port>` without configuring DNS. The assigned port is stored in `sites.yaml` and reused across restarts. The proxy rewrites the Host header so nginx routes correctly, and rewrites absolute URLs in HTML/CSS/JS responses so asset and redirect URLs point to the LAN address instead of the `.test` domain. See [LAN sharing](/usage/lan-sharing) for details.

`lerd share` (without `lan:`) is different: it wraps an external tunnel tool (ngrok/cloudflared/Expose/SSH) to expose the site to the **public internet**.

### Full LAN exposure (all sites, DNS-based)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd lan:expose` | Expose all lerd services to the LAN: binds nginx to `0.0.0.0`, starts the DNS forwarder |
| `lerd lan:unexpose` | Restrict everything back to `127.0.0.1` |
| `lerd lan:status` | Show whether lerd is currently exposed to the local network |

See [Remote / LAN Development](/usage/remote-development) for the full walkthrough.

## PHP

Supported PHP versions: **8.5**, **8.4**, **8.3**, **8.2**, **8.1**, and the frozen legacy tier **8.0** and **7.4**. The legacy tier is opt-in only (you have to `lerd use 7.4` or `lerd isolate 7.4` explicitly), pulls from `php:7.4-fpm-alpine` / `php:8.0-fpm-alpine` upstream tags, and intentionally skips ext-mongodb (unavailable on those PHP versions). Use the legacy tier for hosted legacy apps; default new projects to 8.4 LTS or 8.5.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd use <version>` | Set the global PHP version and build the FPM image if needed |
| `lerd isolate <version>` | Pin PHP version for cwd: writes `.php-version` and updates `.lerd.yaml` if present, then re-links |
| `lerd php:list` | List all installed PHP-FPM versions |
| `lerd php:rebuild [--local]` | Force-rebuild all installed PHP-FPM images (pulls pre-built base by default; `--local` builds from source) |

| `lerd xdebug on [version] [--mode MODE] [--on-demand]` | Enable Xdebug for a PHP version. `--mode` defaults to `debug`; accepts `coverage`, `develop`, `profile`, `trace`, `gcstats`, or comma combos like `debug,coverage`. `--on-demand` sets `start_with_request=trigger` so nothing auto-connects |
| `lerd xdebug off [version]` | Disable Xdebug |
| `lerd xdebug status` | Show Xdebug enabled/disabled state and active mode for all installed PHP versions |
| `lerd xdebug pause [site] [--list] [--pid PID]` | Break the IDE debugger into a running worker/CLI process via Xdebug's control socket (`xdebugctl`). `--list` shows candidate processes, `--pid` targets one |
| `lerd php:ext add <ext> [version] [--apk-deps PKG[,PKG]]` | Add a custom PHP extension and rebuild the FPM image. `--apk-deps` accepts additional Alpine packages that the extension needs at build time (e.g. `--apk-deps libwebp-dev,libpng-dev` for `gd` with WebP support); the package list is persisted in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml` so future rebuilds reapply it |
| `lerd php:ext remove <ext> [version]` | Remove a custom PHP extension and rebuild |
| `lerd php:ext list [version]` | List custom extensions for a PHP version |
| `lerd php:ini [version]` | Open the user php.ini for a PHP version in `$EDITOR` |
| `lerd dump on` | Enable the debug bridge so `dump()` / `dd()` calls ship to the lerd dashboard, TUI, and MCP tools |
| `lerd dump off` | Disable the debug bridge and restore FPM containers to their default state |
| `lerd dump status` | Show whether the bridge is enabled and how many events are buffered |
| `lerd dump tail [--site X] [--branch Y] [--ctx fpm\|cli]` | Stream captured dumps to the terminal until Ctrl-C |
| `lerd dump clear` | Clear the in-memory dump ring without disabling the bridge |
| `lerd profile on` | Turn the SPX profiler on so every PHP-FPM site's requests are profiled into flame graphs |
| `lerd profile off` | Turn the SPX profiler off |
| `lerd profile status` | Show whether the profiler is on and the SPX web UI URL |
| `lerd profile open` | Open the SPX profiler web UI in the browser |
| `lerd profile run <command> [args...]` | Profile a one-off CLI command (e.g. `lerd profile run artisan queue:work`) |
| `lerd profile clear` | Delete all captured SPX profile reports |
| `lerd notify on` | Enable lerd notifications globally (dashboard banners + Web Push fanout) |
| `lerd notify off` | Globally mute lerd notifications; bypasses per-device prefs |
| `lerd notify status` | Show whether notifications are globally enabled |

## Runtime

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd runtime` | Print the current runtime for the site in cwd |
| `lerd runtime frankenphp` | Switch to per-site FrankenPHP (non-worker); writes `runtime: frankenphp` to `.lerd.yaml` |
