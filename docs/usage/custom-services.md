# Custom services

Custom services let you define any OCI-based service (MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Soketi, Stripe Mock, etc.) that integrates with `lerd service`, `lerd env`, and the dashboard. Related: [Service presets](service-presets.md) for ready-made installers, [Services](services.md) for the built-in list.

Lerd lets you define arbitrary OCI-based services that integrate seamlessly with `lerd service`, `lerd start`/`stop`, and `lerd env`, without recompiling.

Custom service configs live at `~/.config/lerd/services/<name>.yaml`.

## Adding a custom service

**From a YAML file** (recommended for reuse or sharing):

```bash
lerd service add mongodb.yaml
```

**With flags** (quick one-off):

```bash
lerd service add \
  --name mongodb \
  --image docker.io/library/mongo:7 \
  --port 27017:27017 \
  --env MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root \
  --env MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
  --data-dir /data/db \
  --env-var "MONGO_DATABASE={{site}}" \
  --env-var "MONGO_URI=mongodb://root:secret@lerd-mongodb:27017/{{site}}" \
  --detect-key MONGO_URI \
  --init-exec "mongosh admin -u root -p secret --eval \"db.getSiblingDB('{{site}}').createCollection('_init')\""
```

## Removing a service (custom or default)

```bash
lerd service remove mongodb            # stops + removes; data preserved
lerd service remove mongodb --purge    # also wipes data dir
```

`lerd service remove` works for any service, including default presets (postgres, redis, mariadb, mysql, meilisearch, mailpit, rustfs). The flow stops the unit if it's running, removes the container, deletes the quadlet, and removes the on-disk config (a no-op for default presets, which are embedded in the binary).

Pass `--purge` to also wipe the persistent data. The data dir at `~/.local/share/lerd/data/<service>/` is **renamed aside** to `<service>.pre-remove-<timestamp>` (a sibling directory), not hard-deleted. To recover, rename it back before reinstalling. The orphaned aside copies can be cleaned up later by hand.

Without `--purge`, data is preserved and a subsequent `lerd service preset install <name>` (for default presets) or `lerd service add` (for custom services) will pick up where you left off.

## Reinstalling a service

```bash
lerd service reinstall postgres                # same version, data preserved
lerd service reinstall postgres --reset-data   # same version, fresh data
```

`reinstall` stops, removes, and reinstalls the service at its current version. Use it when:

- A service update produced data incompatible with the new image and you want a clean slate.
- The container has drifted into a bad state and a full quadlet rewrite would be cleaner than a restart.

`--reset-data` adds a data-dir rename-aside (same recovery semantics as `--purge`) and **automatically reprovisions linked-site state** on the freshly installed service:

- For database families (mysql, mariadb, postgres): each linked site's expected database is created via `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`. The database name comes from `.lerd.yaml` `db.database`, then `.env` `DB_DATABASE`, then the site name with hyphens converted to underscores.
- For object-storage families (rustfs): each linked site's expected bucket is created via `mc mb`. The bucket name comes from `.env` `AWS_BUCKET`, otherwise derived from the site name.
- For cache services (redis, memcached): no per-site state to recreate, so reprovisioning is a no-op.

If a single linked site fails to reprovision (e.g. malformed `.env`), the reinstall continues with the remaining sites and reports the joined errors at the end.

## Tuning a service

```bash
lerd service config mariadb            # open the tuning override in $EDITOR, then restart
lerd service config mariadb --path     # just print the file path (no editor, no restart)
lerd service config mariadb --no-restart
```

`lerd service config` opens a user-editable tuning override for the service in `$EDITOR`. Lerd seeds the file once with a commented template and **never overwrites it afterward**, so your edits survive `lerd service reinstall` and `lerd update`. The override is bind-mounted *after* the bundled preset config, so any value you set wins. Saving restarts the service so it re-reads the config.

Works for both custom services and built-in default presets (e.g. `lerd service preset install mariadb` then `lerd service config mariadb`). The bundled mysql, mariadb, redis, and postgres families ship with a built-in tuning mount. Postgres needs a small wrapper: a bare `-c include_dir=...` is rejected at runtime, so lerd points postgres at a managed `config_file` that loads the cluster's own `postgresql.conf` first and then your override directory, additive, so your values win. For any other image, declare your own tuning mount in the service YAML with a `tuning:` block:

```yaml
name: my-cache
image: docker.io/library/memcached:1.6-alpine
tuning:
  target: /etc/memcached.conf         # required, where the override mounts in the container
  template: |                          # optional, the seed body shown on first edit
    # Lerd user tuning for memcached
    # Uncomment, tune, then save to apply.
    # -m 128
  command: memcached -f /etc/memcached.conf   # optional, only when the image needs to be told to read the file
```

The inline `tuning:` block exposes the Config tab and the `lerd service config <name>` CLI for any custom service. `target` is required; if your image already auto-includes its target path, leave `command` empty (mysql / mariadb work this way). Set `command` when the image loads no config by default (redis is the built-in example). Inline tuning wins over the family-keyed defaults, so you can override the bundled mysql/mariadb/redis paths if you ship a non-standard image.

The service must already be installed — running `lerd service config <name>` against a service whose quadlet isn't on disk errors out with a hint to `lerd service preset install <name>` first, rather than silently reinstalling it as a side effect of an edit.

## Site handle placeholders

`env_vars` values and `site_init.exec` support two placeholders that are substituted per-project when `lerd env` runs:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
<div v-pre>

| Placeholder | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `{{site}}` | Project site handle (derived from the registered site name or directory name, hyphens converted to underscores) |
| `{{site_testing}}` | Same as `{{site}}` with `_testing` appended |
| `{{mysql_version}}` | Major version of the MySQL service image (e.g. `8.0`) |
| `{{postgres_version}}` | Major version of the PostgreSQL service image (e.g. `16`) |
| `{{redis_version}}` | Major version of the Redis service image (e.g. `7`) |
| `{{meilisearch_version}}` | Version of the Meilisearch service image (e.g. `1.7`) |

These are not limited to database names; use them anywhere a per-project identifier is needed (a bucket name, a queue prefix, a namespace, etc.).

</div>

## How `lerd env` uses custom services

When `lerd env` runs in a project directory, it checks each custom service's `env_detect` rule against the project's `.env`. If a match is found:

1. `env_vars` are written into `.env`, with <code v-pre>{{site}}</code> and <code v-pre>{{site_testing}}</code> substituted
2. The service is started if not already running
3. `site_init.exec` is run inside the container (if defined)

## How `lerd start` / `lerd stop` handle custom services

`lerd start` and `lerd stop` include any custom service that has a quadlet file installed (i.e. has been started at least once via `lerd service start`). They are started and stopped alongside the built-in services.

Custom service containers are given a 5-second graceful stop window before podman sends `SIGKILL`. This keeps `lerd service stop` and the web UI's Stop button responsive even for images with slow shutdown sequences (Selenium Chromium/supervisord, for example, can otherwise block for 30 s+). On Podman 5.0+ this is emitted as the native `StopTimeout=5` quadlet key; on Podman 4.x (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04's 4.9.3) lerd writes `PodmanArgs=--stop-timeout=5` instead, since the `StopTimeout=` key only exists in 5.0+. Existing installs of a slow-stopping service can pick up the change with `lerd service remove <name> && lerd service preset <name>`.

## Pinning services

By default, lerd can auto-stop services that no active site references in its `.env`. Use `pin` to keep a service running regardless of which sites are active:

```bash
lerd service pin mysql    # always keep MySQL running
lerd service pin redis
```

Pinning a service also starts it immediately if it is not already running. Unpin to restore normal auto-stop behaviour:

```bash
lerd service unpin mysql
```

Pinned services are shown with a `[pinned]` note in `lerd service list` and the web UI.

## Manually stopped services

If you stop a service with `lerd service stop` (or via the web UI), lerd records it as **manually paused**. `lerd start` and autostart on login will skip it; the service stays stopped until you explicitly start it again.

`lerd stop` + `lerd start` restores the previous state: services that were running before `lerd stop` start again; services you had manually stopped remain stopped.

## `lerd service list` output

Services are shown in a two-column format optimised for narrow terminals. Custom services include a `[custom]` marker. Inactive reasons and dependency info appear as indented sub-lines:

```
Service              Status
────────────────────────────────
mysql                active
redis                inactive
  no sites using this service
phpmyadmin           active  [custom]
  depends on: mysql
```

- **no sites using this service**: the service was auto-stopped because no active site's `.env` references it
- **depends on: ...**: the service has declared dependencies (see "Service dependencies" below)

## Service dependencies

Custom services can declare that they need another service to be running first using `depends_on`. Lerd uses this to automatically manage start and stop order.

**Define via YAML:**

```yaml
# ~/.config/lerd/services/phpmyadmin.yaml
name: phpmyadmin
image: docker.io/phpmyadmin:latest
ports:
  - 8080:80
depends_on:
  - mysql
dashboard: http://localhost:8080
description: "phpMyAdmin web interface for MySQL"
```

**Define via flags:**

```bash
lerd service add \
  --name phpmyadmin \
  --image docker.io/phpmyadmin:latest \
  --port 8080:80 \
  --depends-on mysql \
  --dashboard http://localhost:8080
```

**Behaviour:**

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `lerd service start phpmyadmin` | Starts `mysql` first (if not already running), then starts `phpmyadmin` |
| `lerd service start mysql` | Starts `mysql`, then also starts any services that depend on it (e.g. `phpmyadmin`) |
| `lerd service stop mysql` | Stops `phpmyadmin` first (cascade), then stops `mysql` |
| Site pause (auto-stops `mysql`) | `phpmyadmin` is stopped first, then `mysql` |
| Site unpause (starts `mysql`) | `mysql` starts, then `phpmyadmin` starts |

Multiple dependencies are supported:

```yaml
depends_on:
  - mysql
  - redis
```

Dependencies can be built-in services (`mysql`, `redis`, `postgres`, `meilisearch`, `rustfs`, `mailpit`) or other custom services.

::: info
Circular dependencies (A depends on B, B depends on A) are not detected at definition time. The start cycle is naturally broken because a service already active is skipped. Avoid circular configurations.

## Example: Soketi (Pusher-compatible WebSocket server)

Soketi is a self-hosted Pusher-compatible WebSocket server. Use this if you prefer a standalone container over Laravel Reverb.

```yaml
# ~/.config/lerd/services/soketi.yaml
name: soketi
image: quay.io/soketi/soketi:latest-16-alpine
description: "Pusher-compatible WebSocket server"
ports:
  - 6001:6001
  - 9601:9601
environment:
  SOKETI_DEFAULT_APP_ID: lerd
  SOKETI_DEFAULT_APP_KEY: lerd-key
  SOKETI_DEFAULT_APP_SECRET: lerd-secret
env_vars:
  - BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher
  - PUSHER_APP_ID=lerd
  - PUSHER_APP_KEY=lerd-key
  - PUSHER_APP_SECRET=lerd-secret
  - PUSHER_HOST=lerd-soketi
  - PUSHER_PORT=6001
  - PUSHER_SCHEME=http
  - PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1
  - VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
  - VITE_PUSHER_HOST="${PUSHER_HOST}"
  - VITE_PUSHER_PORT="${PUSHER_PORT}"
  - VITE_PUSHER_SCHEME="${PUSHER_SCHEME}"
  - VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
env_detect:
  key: PUSHER_HOST
  value_prefix: "lerd-soketi"
dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:9601
```

```bash
lerd service add ~/.config/lerd/services/soketi.yaml
lerd service start soketi
```

Soketi metrics UI: `http://127.0.0.1:9601`

## Example: Stripe (Laravel Cashier)

Two services cover the typical Cashier local dev workflow:

**stripe-mock**: a local Stripe API mock. No Stripe account needed. Use this for feature tests that exercise Cashier without hitting the real API.

```yaml
# ~/.config/lerd/services/stripe-mock.yaml
name: stripe-mock
image: docker.io/stripemock/stripe-mock:latest
description: "Local Stripe API mock for Cashier testing"
ports:
  - 12111:12111
```

```bash
lerd service add ~/.config/lerd/services/stripe-mock.yaml
lerd service start stripe-mock
```

Point the Stripe PHP SDK at the mock in your `AppServiceProvider` or test bootstrap:

```php
\Stripe\Stripe::$apiBase = 'http://lerd-stripe-mock:12111';
```
