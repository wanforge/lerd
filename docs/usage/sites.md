## Project initialisation

`lerd init` runs an interactive wizard, writes the answers to `.lerd.yaml` in the project root, and then applies the configuration: linking the site, enabling HTTPS if requested, picking a database, and starting any required services.

```bash
cd ~/Projects/my-app
lerd init
```

```
? PHP version: 8.5
? Node version (leave blank to skip):
? Enable HTTPS? No
? Database:
  > SQLite (no service)
    MySQL (lerd-mysql)
    PostgreSQL (lerd-postgres)
? Services:
  ◉ redis
  ◯ meilisearch
  ◯ rustfs
  ◯ mailpit
Saved .lerd.yaml
Linked: my-app -> my-app.test (PHP 8.5, Node 22, Framework: laravel)
```

Wizard defaults are populated intelligently on first run:

- **PHP version**: from the site registry if already linked, otherwise from `.php-version`, `composer.json`, or the global default
- **Enable HTTPS**: pre-checked if the site is already secured
- **Database**: pre-selected from any database already in `.lerd.yaml`, otherwise from `DB_CONNECTION` in `.env` (or `.env.example` for a fresh clone), falling back to SQLite (Laravel's default for new projects)
- **Services**: pre-checked based on what's detected in the project's `.env` file (only non-database services here, since the database is its own step)

The Database step is a single choice rather than a multi-select, so picking MySQL automatically deselects SQLite and vice-versa. After the wizard completes, `lerd env` runs automatically to write your choices to `.env`:

- **MySQL / PostgreSQL**: `DB_CONNECTION` and the related `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_DATABASE` / `DB_USERNAME` / `DB_PASSWORD` keys are rewritten to point at `lerd-mysql` / `lerd-postgres`, the service is started if it isn't already, and the project database (plus a `_testing` variant) is created.
- **SQLite**: `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and `DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite` are written to `.env`, and the `database/database.sqlite` file is created if it doesn't exist. No service is started.

The choice is authoritative: if `.env` already had `DB_CONNECTION=mysql` from a previous setup and you switch to SQLite (or vice versa) in the wizard, lerd skips the auto-detection of the old database and applies your new pick instead.

The same prompt also appears when you run `lerd env` directly on a project whose `.env` says SQLite and whose `.lerd.yaml` doesn't yet have a database picked, for example, after cloning a project that wasn't created with `lerd init`. The prompt is skipped automatically when stdin isn't a TTY (e.g. `lerd setup --all` in CI), and for frameworks with explicit env service rules (`fw.env.services` in the YAML, like Symfony, WordPress, etc.) since those don't use Laravel's `DB_CONNECTION` convention.

Persistence is one-way: lerd reads the source of truth from `.lerd.yaml` and writes only to `.env`. `.env.example` is never modified; it's only used as a template when `.env` doesn't exist yet.

The resulting `.lerd.yaml` is intended to be committed to the repository. On a new machine or after a reinstall, running `lerd init` again reads the saved file and restores the full configuration without any prompts.

```bash
# On a fresh machine, no wizard, config applied directly
git clone ...
cd my-app
lerd init
```

Use `--fresh` to re-run the wizard while keeping existing values as defaults:

```bash
lerd init --fresh
```

## Non-PHP / custom container sites

For Node.js, Python, Go, or any other non-PHP runtime, lerd builds a dedicated container image per project and has nginx reverse-proxy to it. The workflow differs from PHP sites:

1. Create a `Containerfile.lerd` in the project root that defines the runtime and start command.
2. Run `lerd init`; it detects the non-PHP project (no `composer.json`) and switches to custom container mode, asking for the port, HTTPS, and services. It writes `.lerd.yaml` for you. Alternatively write `.lerd.yaml` manually with a `container: {port: N}` section.
3. Run `lerd link`; it builds the image, starts the container as `lerd-custom-<sitename>`, and generates the nginx vhost.

> **Important:** calling `lerd link` without the container config registers the project as a PHP-FPM site (wrong). If that happened, run `lerd unlink` first, set up the files, then `lerd link` again.

See [Custom Containers](custom-containers.md) for the full configuration reference.

### Static sites

A project that is just a `public_dir` of HTML/CSS/JS with no `composer.json` and no `.php` files is served directly by nginx as a static site. lerd recognises these as non-PHP, so the site detail panel hides every PHP-only surface: the PHP version dropdown, the Xdebug toggle button, the Tinker and Dumps tabs, and the PHP-FPM logs tab. A site counts as PHP only when it has a `composer.json` or a top-level `.php` file, or runs under a custom container or FrankenPHP.

---

## Projects outside the home directory

By default, the PHP-FPM and nginx containers only have access to files under `$HOME`. If your project lives elsewhere (e.g. `/var/www`, `/opt/projects`, `/var/local`), lerd automatically detects this and adds the required volume mount to both containers.

This happens transparently when you:

- **`lerd link`** or **`lerd park`** a directory outside `$HOME`
- Run **`lerd php`**, **`composer`**, **`laravel new`**, or any exec command from an outside path

The containers are restarted once to pick up the new mount. Subsequent commands from the same path run without delay. When you unlink or unpark, stale mounts are cleaned up automatically.

---

## Domain naming

Directories with real TLDs are automatically normalised: dots are replaced with dashes and the TLD is stripped before appending `.test`.

For example: `admin.example.com` becomes `admin-example.test`

---

## Multiple domains

A site can respond to multiple domains. The argument to `lerd link` is the domain name without the `.test` TLD; it is appended automatically from the global config.

```bash
lerd link myapp                # links as myapp.test
```

After linking, you can add more domains:

```bash
lerd domain add api            # adds api.test
lerd domain add admin          # adds admin.test
lerd domain list
#   myapp.test (primary)
#   api.test
#   admin.test
lerd domain remove api         # removes api.test
```

Domains are stored in `.lerd.yaml` as an array (without the TLD) so the file stays portable across machines with different TLD configurations:

```yaml
domains:
  - myapp
  - admin
```

You can also manage domains from the web UI: click the pencil icon next to the domain in the site header to open the domain management modal. Changing the primary domain there also rewrites `APP_URL` in the project's `.env` to match the new primary, unless you have pinned a custom `app_url` (see [Custom `APP_URL`](#custom-app-url) below).

When a site is secured with HTTPS, the certificate is automatically reissued to cover all domains.

Subdomains (e.g. `anything.myapp.test`) are automatically routed to the same site. Git worktree subdomains take priority when they exist.

To route a subdomain to a **different** site instead (for example a separate admin app at `admin.myapp.test`), group the two sites rather than adding an alias. See [Site Groups](site-groups.md).

---

## Domain conflicts

A domain may only be claimed by one site at a time. When `lerd link`, the watcher's auto-registration, or a `.lerd.yaml`-driven re-link tries to register a domain that another site already owns, the conflicting domain is **filtered out** (not the whole site) and a warning is printed:

```
$ lerd link
  [WARN] domain "shared.test" already used by site "owner-app", skipped
Linked: clone-app -> clone-app.test (PHP 8.5, Node 22, Framework: laravel)
```

The site still gets registered with whatever domains survived the filter. If every requested domain is conflicted, lerd falls back to a freshly generated `<dirname>.<tld>` (with a numeric suffix to avoid name collisions).

`.lerd.yaml` is **never modified** when this happens; the original `domains:` list stays on disk so the conflict is visible to the UI and the entry self-heals on the next link if you remove the owning site. The web UI surfaces filtered domains in two places:

- The site detail header's domain pill shows an amber ⚠️ when one or more declared domains are filtered (`+N more` count includes them). Hovering reveals each conflicted entry with the owning site name.
- The Manage Domains modal lists conflicted entries at the top with a warning icon, the domain struck-through, a `used by <site>` pill, and a small trash button. Clicking the trash removes the entry from `.lerd.yaml` only; the registry, vhost, and certs are untouched.

The conflict check is **strict**: a domain is reserved regardless of TLS scheme. Two sites cannot share the same domain even if one runs HTTPS and the other HTTP; DNS and browser caches don't reliably disambiguate by scheme, and the resulting setup is fragile.

---

## Custom `APP_URL`

By default `lerd env` writes `APP_URL=<scheme>://<primary-domain>` to the project's `.env` on every run. If you need to override that (for example to add a path prefix, point at a staging hostname, or pin a specific protocol), set `app_url` in `.lerd.yaml` (committed, shared across machines) or in the per-machine site entry in `~/.local/share/lerd/sites.yaml`. The precedence chain is:

1. `.lerd.yaml` `app_url`: committed to the repo, takes effect on every machine.
2. `sites.yaml` `app_url`: per-machine override, useful when only one developer needs a different URL.
3. The default generator (`<scheme>://<primary-domain>`): used when neither override is set.

```yaml
# .lerd.yaml
domains:
  - myapp
app_url: http://myapp.test/api
```

`lerd env` reads the chain on every invocation, so editing the file and re-running `lerd setup` (or `lerd env` directly) is enough to apply the change. If the `.lerd.yaml` `app_url` happens to point at a domain that got filtered by the conflict check, lerd silently falls through to the next precedence level so you don't end up writing a `DB_HOST` of `lerd-mysql` next to an `APP_URL` that points at someone else's site.

---

## Workers

The `lerd init` wizard includes a workers step that lets you select which workers to auto-start when linking. Available workers depend on the framework and what's installed:

- **queue**: shown when the framework defines a queue worker (replaced by horizon when `laravel/horizon` is installed)
- **horizon**: shown only when `laravel/horizon` is in `composer.json`
- **schedule**: the task scheduler
- **reverb**: shown only when `laravel/reverb` is installed or `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` is in `.env`
- **custom workers**: any additional workers defined in the framework definition

Selected workers are saved to `.lerd.yaml`:

```yaml
workers:
  - horizon
  - schedule
```

When `lerd link` runs and workers are configured but not yet running, it prompts to run `lerd setup` so you can install dependencies, run migrations, and start workers in the right order. If workers are already running (re-link), they are left as-is.

`lerd setup` pre-selects worker steps based on the `.lerd.yaml` workers list. Workers not in the list still appear in the step selector but are unchecked.

Toggling workers from the CLI (`lerd queue:start`, `lerd schedule:stop`, etc.) or the web UI syncs the running state back to `.lerd.yaml` when the file exists.

`lerd check` validates that listed workers are valid for the detected framework.

`lerd status` includes a Workers section showing all active, restarting, or failed workers across sites. In the web UI, failing workers show a pulsing red toggle and their log tab appears with a "!" indicator.

---

## Name collision handling

When a directory is parked or linked and another site is already registered with the same name:

- **Same path**: treated as a re-link of the same site. The existing registration is updated and the TLS state is preserved.
- **Different path**: the new site is registered with a numeric suffix (`myapp-2`, `myapp-3`, etc.) so both sites can coexist.

---

## Linking from the web UI

You can link a new site directly from the dashboard by clicking the **+** button in the sites panel header. A directory browser modal lets you navigate to the project folder and click **Link This Directory**. After linking, the site's `.env` is auto-configured and the UI switches to the new site's settings.

---

## Unlinked domains

When you visit a `.test` domain that isn't linked to any site over **HTTP**, lerd shows a branded "Site Not Found" page with a link to the dashboard and a retry button. This replaces the browser's generic connection error.

For **HTTPS** the catch-all uses `ssl_reject_handshake on;`, so the browser sees a clean `ERR_SSL_UNRECOGNIZED_NAME_ALERT` connection error rather than a landing page. This is unavoidable: lerd cannot pre-issue a certificate covering arbitrary `*.test` hostnames because browsers (Chrome especially) reject TLD-level wildcard certificates with `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`. If you're hitting this on a domain you used to have linked, the fix is browser-side (clear site data / unregister the service worker), not server-side.

---

## Unlink behaviour

When you unlink a site that lives inside a parked directory, the vhost is removed but the registry entry is kept and marked as *ignored*; the watcher will not re-register it on its next scan. Running `lerd link` in that directory clears the ignored flag and restores the site.

---

## Pausing sites

Pausing a site frees up resources without removing it from lerd. It is useful when you're switching focus between projects and want to stop workers and silence a site without fully unlinking it.

```bash
lerd pause              # pause the site in the current directory
lerd pause my-project   # pause a named site
```

When a site is paused:

- All running workers for that site are stopped (queue, schedule, reverb, stripe, and any custom workers)
- The nginx vhost is replaced with a minimal landing page that shows a **Resume** button
- Services no longer needed by any other active site are auto-stopped
- The paused state is persisted, so the site stays paused across `lerd start` / `lerd stop` cycles

The landing page's **Resume** button calls the lerd dashboard API directly, so you can unpause from the browser without opening a terminal.

```bash
lerd unpause              # resume the site in the current directory
lerd unpause my-project   # resume a named site
```

When a site is unpaused:

- The original nginx vhost is restored (including HTTPS if the site is secured)
- Any services referenced in the site's `.env` are started
- Workers that were running before the pause are restarted

Paused sites still appear in `lerd sites` output and the web UI. Their status is shown as `paused`.

### Running CLI commands on a paused site

You can run `php artisan`, `composer`, `lerd db:export`, and other exec-based commands on a paused site without unpausing it first. If any services the site needs (MySQL, Redis, etc.) were auto-stopped when the site was paused, lerd starts them automatically before running the command:

```
$ php artisan migrate
[lerd] site "my-project" is paused, starting required services...
  Starting mysql...

   INFO  Nothing to migrate.
```

On subsequent commands the services are already running, so no notice is printed. The site stays paused; the nginx vhost remains as the landing page and workers are not restarted.

Commands that benefit from this auto-start:

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| `php artisan <args>` / `lerd artisan <args>` | Any artisan command |
| `php <args>` / `lerd php <args>` | Any PHP script |
| `composer <args>` | Composer via the lerd shim |
| `lerd shell` | Opens an interactive shell in the PHP-FPM container |
| `lerd db:import` | Imports a SQL dump |
| `lerd db:export` | Exports a database |
| `lerd db:shell` | Opens an interactive DB shell |

---

## Git worktrees

Lerd automatically creates a subdomain for each `git worktree` checkout. See [Git Worktrees](../features/git-worktrees.md) for details.

---

## Sharing sites

`lerd share` exposes the current site via a public tunnel. Requires [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download), [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/), or [Expose](https://expose.dev) to be installed.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd share` | Share the current site (auto-detects ngrok, cloudflared, or Expose) |
| `lerd share <name>` | Share a named site |
| `lerd share --ngrok` | Force ngrok |
| `lerd share --cloudflare` | Force Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) |
| `lerd share --expose` | Force Expose |
| `lerd share --localhost-run` | Force localhost.run (SSH, no signup) |
| `lerd share --serveo` | Force serveo.net (SSH, no signup) |

A local reverse proxy rewrites the `Host` header to the site's domain so nginx routes to the correct vhost. Response `Location` headers and HTML/CSS/JS/JSON body references to the local domain are also rewritten to the public tunnel URL, so redirects and asset links work correctly in the browser.

When the tunnel forwards an `X-Forwarded-Host` header (the public hostname the visitor actually typed), lerd's generated vhosts propagate it into `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_NAME`, and the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_*` family, so PHP apps that build absolute URLs from `$_SERVER` or Laravel's `url()` helper return the public URL instead of the local `.test` one. See [Nginx Overrides](./nginx-overrides.md#forwarded-headers-and-tunneling) for the full mapping, and for how to drop per-site snippets under `~/.local/share/lerd/nginx/custom.d/` without losing them on the next `lerd update`.
