# Node

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `lerd node:install <version>` | Install a Node.js version globally via fnm |
| `lerd node:uninstall <version>` | Uninstall a Node.js version via fnm |
| `lerd node:use <version>` | Set the global default Node.js version |
| `lerd isolate:node <version>` | Pin Node version for cwd: writes `.node-version`, runs `fnm install` |

---

## Usage

`lerd install` places shims for `node`, `npm`, and `npx` in `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/`, which is added to your `PATH`. You use them exactly as you normally would, lerd picks the right version automatically:

```bash
node --version
npm install
npx tsc --init
```

---

## Version resolution

1. `.lerd.yaml`: `node_version` field (explicit lerd override, highest priority)
2. `.nvmrc` in the project root
3. `.node-version` in the project root
4. `package.json`: `engines.node` field
5. Global default in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml`

To pin a project to a specific version:

```bash
cd ~/Lerd/my-app
lerd isolate:node 20
# writes .node-version and installs Node 20 via fnm
```

To install a version without pinning a project:

```bash
lerd node:install 22
```

---

## Default version

`lerd node:use <version>` sets the global default and stores it in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml`. Sites without a pinned version use this default.

```bash
lerd node:use 22
```

Version numbers are normalised to the major only, so `22.11.0` and `22.14.1` are both treated as `22`, and only one entry per major appears in the UI and CLI.

## fnm

Node version management is handled by [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), which is bundled and installed automatically. The `node`, `npm`, and `npx` shims in `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/` invoke the correct version via fnm for each project.

---

## Global npm packages

`npm install -g <pkg>` works through the lerd shim. The package goes to a lerd managed prefix at `~/.local/share/lerd/node-global/`, and lerd writes a small wrapper script for every binary into `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/`, which is already on your `PATH` because `lerd install` adds it. After `npm install -g pm2` you can call `pm2` from any shell directly, no extra setup, on both Linux and macOS regardless of whether lerd itself was installed via Homebrew or curl-pipe.

The wrapper exec's the real binary through `fnm exec --using=default`, so globally installed tools always run on the fnm default node version regardless of the project you are inside when you call them. If you need a specific version for a global tool, change the default with `lerd node:use <version>` before installing it.

`npm uninstall -g <pkg>` removes the wrapper as well. Files in `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/` that lerd did not create with its own marker comment are never touched, so the existing `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `php`, `composer`, and `laravel` shims in the same directory stay safe.

The same mechanism applies to `composer global require`. Composer's global vendor/bin (`~/.config/composer/vendor/bin/` by default, respecting `COMPOSER_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) is mirrored into `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/` after every `composer` run, with wrappers that exec the real bin through `lerd php` so `#!/usr/bin/env php` shebangs resolve against the FPM container. After `composer global require psy/psysh` you can call `psysh` from any shell directly. `composer global remove` cleans the wrapper too.

## System-managed vs lerd-managed Node

If `lerd install` detects an existing `node`, `npm`, or `npx` on your `PATH` or under a known version-manager directory (nvm, volta, mise, asdf, fnm), it asks **"Let lerd manage Node.js?"** before writing any shims.

- **Answer yes**: lerd installs fnm, picks the current LTS, sets it as the fnm default, and writes the `node` / `npm` / `npx` shims into `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/`. Per-project version pinning works as described above.
- **Answer no**: lerd writes nothing into `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/`, removes any stale shims from a previous opt-in, and stays out of your `PATH`. Sites use whatever `node` your shell resolves; per-project pinning is your version manager's job. The dashboard's Node tab disables the install controls and points back at `lerd install` if you change your mind.

`lerd node:install` / `node:use` / `node:uninstall` warn and require confirmation if you run them on a host where lerd isn't currently managing Node, and write fresh shims on accept so CLI opt-in matches the install flow.
