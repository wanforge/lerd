## Per-project config: `.lerd.yaml`

A portable, self-contained description of a project's local environment. Created by `lerd init` or written manually, committed to the repository, and applied automatically by `lerd link` and `lerd init`.

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `php_version` | PHP version for this project (highest priority, overrides `.php-version` and `composer.json`) |
| `node_version` | Node version (highest priority, overrides `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, and `package.json`); writes `.node-version` on apply if the file does not already exist |
| `framework` | Framework name (overrides auto-detection) |
| `framework_def` | Full framework definition, embedded automatically for custom (non-Laravel) frameworks so the project is portable across machines |
| `public_dir` | Override for the framework's default document-root subdirectory, e.g. `public_html` for a Laravel skeleton that doesn't use the conventional `public/` folder. Empty means use the framework default |
| `request_timeout` | nginx request timeout in seconds for this site. Maps to `fastcgi_read_timeout`/`fastcgi_send_timeout` for PHP-FPM sites and `proxy_read_timeout`/`proxy_send_timeout` for proxy and custom-container sites. Overrides the global `nginx.request_timeout`. Omit (or `0`) to inherit the global default of 60s. Raise it for apps with deliberately long-running requests |
| `secured` | When `true`, HTTPS is enabled on apply |
| `domains` | Site hostnames without the TLD (e.g. `[myapp, api]`). The first entry is the primary; additional entries become aliases. Conflict-filtered domains stay in this list on disk but are not registered |
| `app_url` | Override for `APP_URL` (or the framework's URL key) written to `.env`. Highest priority, it beats the per-machine `sites.yaml` override and the default `<scheme>://<primary-domain>` generator. Use for custom path prefixes, ports, or unrelated hostnames you want shared across machines |
| `env_overrides` | Map of env var names to templated or static values applied to `.env` on `lerd setup` and to per-worktree `.env` files when worktrees are created. Values may use <code v-pre>{{domain}}</code>, <code v-pre>{{scheme}}</code>, <code v-pre>{{site}}</code>, <code v-pre>{{branch}}</code>, and <code v-pre>{{parent}}</code> placeholders, or be plain strings. When `APP_URL` is in `env_overrides` it takes precedence over the default rewrite; declared keys override defaults, undeclared defaults still apply. The one exception is `DB_DATABASE` on a worktree whose `db_isolated` is true: the isolation flow owns that key and the watcher won't re-render it from the parent's template until isolation is turned back off. See [Env overrides](./features/git-worktrees.md#env-overrides) |
| `services` | Services to start on apply. Accepts built-in names, custom service names, or full inline definitions |
| `workers` | Active worker names for the site (e.g. `queue`, `horizon`, `schedule`, `reverb`, `stripe`). Automatically kept in sync by start/stop commands. Used by `lerd start` to restore workers after reinstall |
| `container` | Custom container config for non-PHP sites. When present, lerd builds a dedicated container from the project's Containerfile and nginx reverse-proxies to it. See below and [Custom Containers](./usage/custom-containers.md) |
| `custom_workers` | Custom worker definitions (name to config map). Works for both PHP and custom container sites. See below |
| `db` | Database targeting for non-PHP projects: `service` (e.g. `mysql`, `postgres`) and `database` name |

### Basic example

```yaml
php_version: "8.5"
node_version: "22"
framework: laravel
secured: true
services:
  - mysql
  - redis
```

### Custom public folder

When the project ships with a non-standard document root (e.g. a Laravel skeleton that uses `public_html/` instead of `public/`), set `public_dir`:

```yaml
framework: laravel
public_dir: public_html
```

On `lerd link` this value becomes the site's document root in the generated nginx vhost; it takes precedence over the framework's default. No need to define a full `framework_def` just to change the doc root.

### Custom container example

For non-PHP sites (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.), define a `container` section instead of `php_version` and `framework`:

```yaml
domains:
  - nestapp
container:
  port: 3000
  containerfile: Containerfile.lerd
services:
  - mysql
  - redis
custom_workers:
  dev-server:
    label: Dev Server
    command: npm run start:dev
    restart: always
```

When `container` is present, `php_version`, `framework`, and `node_version` are ignored.

#### `container` fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | yes | | Port the app listens on inside the container |
| `containerfile` | no | `Containerfile.lerd` | Path to the Containerfile (relative to project root) |
| `build_context` | no | `.` | Build context directory (relative to project root) |

See [Custom Containers](./usage/custom-containers.md) for the full guide.

### Custom workers

Custom workers can be defined for any site type (PHP or custom container). Each entry in `custom_workers` maps a name to a worker config:

```yaml
custom_workers:
  queue:
    label: Queue Worker
    command: node dist/queue.js
    restart: always
  cron:
    label: Cron Job
    command: node dist/cron.js
    restart: on-failure
    schedule: minutely
```

#### Worker config fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `label` | no | worker name | Display name in the dashboard |
| `command` | yes | | Shell command to run inside the container |
| `restart` | no | `always` | `always` or `on-failure` |
| `schedule` | no | | systemd OnCalendar expression for timer-based workers (e.g. `minutely`, `*-*-* *:00:00`) |
| `conflicts_with` | no | | List of worker names to stop before starting this one |
| `host` | no | `false` | Run on the host via fnm instead of inside the PHP-FPM container. Used for Node.js tools (Vite, Tailwind watcher, Encore) that need direct filesystem access for HMR |
| `per_worktree` | no | `false` | Worker can run independently per git worktree under `lerd-<wname>-<site>-<wt>`. Required for worktree auto-start; without it, host workers stay bound to the parent site only |
| `replaces_build` | no | `false` | While running, the worker provides the asset manifest so the static `npm run build` step is unnecessary. `lerd worktree add` skips its build prompt when an opted-in `replaces_build` worker is present |

Worker definitions stay in `custom_workers` permanently. The `workers` field (a separate list of names) tracks which are currently active and is synced automatically by start/stop commands.

Framework yamls (under `lerd-frameworks/frameworks/<framework>/<version>.yaml`) declare workers under a sibling `workers:` block with the same shape, so `host`, `per_worktree`, and `replaces_build` apply there too. The shipped Laravel 11 / 12 / 13 yamls use this for `vite` (`host: true`, `per_worktree: true`, `replaces_build: true`), and any custom framework can do the same to teach lerd about per-branch dev servers.

### Inline custom service definitions

Custom services can be defined directly in `.lerd.yaml` instead of (or in addition to) registering them with `lerd service add`. This makes the project fully self-contained: cloning it and running `lerd link` is enough to reproduce the environment.

```yaml
php_version: "8.5"
node_version: "22"
framework: laravel
secured: true
services:
  - redis
  - mongodb:
      image: docker.io/library/mongo:7
      ports:
        - 27017:27017
      environment:
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      data_dir: /data/db
      description: "MongoDB document store"
      env_vars:
        - MONGO_URI=mongodb://root:secret@lerd-mongodb:27017/{{site}}
      site_init:
        exec: >
          mongosh admin -u root -p secret --eval
          "db.getSiblingDB('{{site}}').createCollection('_init')"
```

The inline definition schema is identical to a [custom service YAML file](./usage/custom-services.md#yaml-schema). On apply, the service is registered to `~/.config/lerd/services/<name>.yaml` then started.

If a service with that name already exists locally and the definitions differ, a diff is shown and you are asked whether to replace it:

```
~ service/mongodb already exists and differs:

--- service/mongodb (current)
+++ service/mongodb (.lerd.yaml)
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
 image: docker.io/library/mongo:7
-description: MongoDB
+description: MongoDB document store
 ...

Replace service/mongodb with the version from .lerd.yaml? (y/N)
```

### Custom frameworks

When `lerd init` runs in a project that uses a custom framework (one added with `lerd framework add`), the full framework definition is embedded under `framework_def`. On a fresh machine the definition is restored automatically before linking, no manual `lerd framework add` step needed.

```yaml
framework: wordpress
framework_def:
  label: WordPress
  public_dir: .
  detect:
    - file: wp-config.php
  env:
    file: .env
  ...
```

If a framework with that name already exists locally and differs from the embedded definition, a diff is shown before applying.

### Applying `.lerd.yaml`

The config is applied whenever `lerd link` or `lerd init` runs in the project root:

- **`lerd link`**: framework definition restored, `.node-version` written, PHP version applied, HTTPS toggled, services registered and started.
- **`lerd init`**: installs PHP FPM if needed, then runs `lerd link` (which applies everything above). Re-runs the wizard if `--fresh` is passed.

Commit `.lerd.yaml` to the repository. On a fresh machine, `lerd link` is sufficient to reproduce the full local environment.

The Lerd watcher also monitors `.lerd.yaml` for changes. When you switch branches with a different config the PHP and Node versions are re-detected and applied automatically, no manual `lerd link` or `lerd init` needed. See [Automatic version switching](./features/project-setup.md#automatic-version-switching) for details.

`lerd isolate`, the UI PHP version selector, and the MCP `site_php` tool all keep `php_version` in sync when this file exists.

`lerd secure`, `lerd unsecure`, the UI HTTPS toggle, and the MCP `secure`/`unsecure` tools keep `secured` in sync when this file exists.
