# Profiler

The profiler answers the question dumps and logs can't: where is a request actually spending its time. lerd bundles [SPX](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx), a low-overhead PHP profiler, into every PHP-FPM image and surfaces its flame graphs through a single global **Profiler** entry in the dashboard.

The profiler is **off by default**. Turn it on with `lerd profile on`, the Start profiling button in the dashboard Profiler view, or `profiler_toggle` via MCP. It is a single global switch: while it is on, every HTTP request to every PHP-FPM site is profiled. Turning it on or off costs nothing but an nginx reload, no FPM restart and no code changes.

## How it works

The SPX extension is always loaded in the FPM image, but it does nothing until a request opts in. Turning the profiler on flips that opt-in for every site:

1. `lerd profile on` sets a global flag in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml` and regenerates every PHP-FPM site's nginx vhost.
2. The regenerated vhost injects an `SPX_ENABLED` cookie into the `HTTP_COOKIE` that nginx passes to PHP-FPM. The browser never sees this cookie, so there is nothing to install and nothing third-party-cookie rules can block.
3. SPX sees the cookie, profiles the request, and writes a report to `~/.local/share/lerd/spx/`.
4. The Profiler view embeds SPX's own report UI, so you browse flame graphs without leaving the dashboard.

A second nginx variable, `$spx_key`, carries the SPX auth key. It resolves to an empty string whenever an `X-Forwarded-Host` header is present, so the profiler and its UI stay unreachable through `lerd share` tunnels and LAN shares. The profiler is a local-only tool.

## Turning the profiler on

```bash
lerd profile on        # profile every PHP-FPM site
lerd profile status    # show the state and the SPX UI URL
lerd profile off       # stop profiling
```

In the dashboard, click the flame icon in the left rail to open the **Profiler** view, then use the **Start profiling** button in its header.

While the profiler is on, every HTTP request to every PHP-FPM site is profiled. Reload the sites you care about a few times, then open the Profiler view to read the reports. Turn it off when you are done so the profiler is not adding overhead to every request.

## Reading flame graphs

The Profiler view embeds the SPX report UI, served by a dedicated `profiler.localhost` nginx vhost so it does not depend on any one site. Each report lists wall time, CPU time, memory, and the call tree. SPX's time-line view is an interactive flame graph: wide frames are where the time went. Click a frame to zoom, and use the flat-profile table to find the most expensive functions.

All reports land in one shared directory, `~/.local/share/lerd/spx/`, regardless of which site or PHP version produced them. Each report is labelled with its request host and URI so they stay distinguishable.

## Profiling CLI commands

The cookie mechanism only covers HTTP requests. To profile an artisan command, a queue job, or a test run, use `lerd profile run`:

```bash
lerd profile run artisan queue:work --once
lerd profile run artisan app:heavy-report
```

The command runs as `php <command>` inside the project's container with SPX enabled, and the report lands in the same Profiler view alongside the HTTP reports. This works whether or not the global profiler is on.

## Open the SPX UI directly

```bash
lerd profile open      # open the SPX web UI in your browser
```

This opens `http://profiler.localhost/?SPX_UI_URI=/`, the same UI the Profiler view embeds.

## Scope and limits

- **PHP-FPM sites only.** FrankenPHP and custom-container sites run images that don't carry the SPX extension, so their requests are not profiled.
- **Sampling, not exact counts.** SPX is a tracing profiler that records wall and CPU time accurately. It is built for "where did the time go", not for exact call counts.
- **Local only.** The profiler is never reachable through tunnels or LAN shares.
- **Reports accumulate** in `~/.local/share/lerd/spx/`. Delete old reports from the SPX UI when the list gets long.

## MCP

AI assistants can drive the profiler through two tools:

- `profiler_toggle({ enable })` turns profiling on or off globally.
- `profiler_status()` reports whether profiling is on and the SPX web UI URL.
