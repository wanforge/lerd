# AI Integration (MCP)

Lerd ships a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, letting AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, JetBrains Junie, and any other MCP-compatible tool) manage your dev environment directly: run migrations, start services, toggle queue workers, and inspect logs without leaving the chat.

---

## Setting up MCP

There are two ways to connect lerd to your AI assistant: globally (recommended) or per-project.

### Global registration (recommended)

Run once after installing lerd:

```bash
lerd mcp:enable-global
```

This registers the lerd MCP server at **user scope**, available in every Claude Code session, regardless of which directory you open. It also updates Cursor, Windsurf, and JetBrains Junie global configs, and writes user-scope skill, rules, and guidelines files so the assistant knows what lerd tools are available and how to use them:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md` | Claude Code user-scope skill |
| `~/.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc` | Cursor user-scope rules |
| `~/.junie/guidelines.md` | JetBrains Junie user-scope guidelines (merged, not overwritten) |

When running globally, the server uses the **directory Claude is opened in** as the site context. No further configuration is needed: just open your AI assistant in a project directory and lerd tools work immediately.

> **During `lerd install`:** If Claude Code is detected, you'll be prompted to run this automatically.

> **During `lerd update`:** When MCP is globally registered, the skill, rules, and guidelines files are automatically rewritten from the newly installed binary so they stay in sync with any added or renamed tools.

### Project-scoped registration

To pin lerd to a specific project path (useful for teams or when sharing config via git):

```bash
cd ~/Lerd/my-app
lerd mcp:inject
```

This writes seven files into the project directory:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server entry for Claude Code |
| `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md` | Skill file that teaches Claude about lerd tools |
| `.cursor/mcp.json` | MCP server entry for Cursor |
| `.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc` | Cursor rules file that teaches Cursor about lerd tools |
| `.ai/mcp/mcp.json` | MCP server entry for Windsurf and other MCP-compatible tools |
| `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` | MCP server entry for JetBrains Junie |
| `.junie/guidelines.md` | Lerd context section for JetBrains Junie (merged, not overwritten) |

The config includes a `LERD_SITE_PATH` environment variable pointing to the project root, which takes precedence over the cwd fallback.

The command **merges** into existing configs; other MCP servers (e.g. `laravel-boost`, `herd`) are left untouched. Re-running it is safe.

To target a different directory:

```bash
lerd mcp:inject --path ~/Lerd/another-app
```

> **During `lerd update`:** Projects that previously ran `mcp:inject` are detected automatically (by the presence of `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc`, or the lerd marker in `.junie/guidelines.md`) and their per-project artefacts are refreshed in place. Directories whose content already matches the new binary stay untouched, so git status stays clean. Projects that never opted in are skipped.

### Path resolution

Tools like `artisan`, `composer`, `env_setup`, `env_check`, `env_override`, `db_export`, `db_import`, and `db_create` accept an optional `path` argument. When omitted, the server resolves the path in this order:

1. Explicit `path` argument (highest priority)
2. `LERD_SITE_PATH` env var (set by `mcp:inject`)
3. Current working directory, the directory Claude was opened in (global sessions)

## Available MCP tools

Once the MCP server is connected, your AI assistant has access to:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `sites` | List all registered lerd sites (name, domain, path, PHP/Node version, framework, worker status) |
| `runtime_versions` | List installed PHP and Node.js versions with configured defaults |
| `php_list` | List all PHP versions installed by lerd, marking the global default |
| `php_ext` | Manage custom PHP extensions for a PHP version — `action`: `list` / `add` / `remove` (`add` and `remove` rebuild the FPM image and restart the container); `add` verifies the extension loaded and accepts `apk_deps` for extra Alpine build packages |
| `artisan` | Run `php artisan` in the PHP-FPM container: migrations, generators, seeders, cache, tinker (Laravel only) |
| `console` | Run the framework's console command (e.g. `php bin/console` for Symfony); shown for non-Laravel frameworks that define a `console` field |
| `composer` | Run `composer` in the PHP-FPM container: install, require, dump-autoload, etc. |
| `node` | Install or uninstall a Node.js version via fnm — `action`: `install` / `uninstall` (e.g. `"20"`, `"lts"`) |
| `env_setup` | Configure `.env` for lerd: detects services, starts them, creates DB (sqlite auto-created when `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`), sets APP_KEY and APP_URL. Always follow with `setup` to run migrations. |
| `setup` | Run the framework's post-install bootstrap steps (Laravel: `storage:link` + `migrate`; Symfony: `doctrine:migrations:migrate` when `doctrine-migrations-bundle` is installed). Mandatory after `env_setup` on new or cloned projects; idempotent. |
| `env_check` | Compare all `.env` files against `.env.example` and flag missing or extra keys (returns structured JSON) |
| `env_override` | Manage the personal, gitignored `.env.lerd_override`; its `KEY=VALUE` pairs win over lerd's defaults on `env_setup`, and `LERD_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=<svc,svc>` marks services lerd writes vars for but won't start/provision. Pass `set` to write entries, or call with no args to scaffold and read it back. |
| `project_new` | Scaffold a new project via `composer create-project` in the PHP-FPM container and run `composer install` so the returned directory has a populated `vendor/`. Followed by `site_link` → `env_setup` → `setup`. |
| `site_link` | Register a directory as a lerd site; generates nginx vhost and `.test` domain |
| `site_unlink` | Unregister a site and remove its nginx vhost (all domains) |
| `site_domain` | Add or remove a site domain (without TLD) — `action`: `add` / `remove`; cannot remove last |
| `park` | Register a parent directory; scans subdirectories and auto-registers any PHP projects as sites |
| `unpark` | Remove a parked directory from lerd and unlink all its sites |
| `site_tls` | Enable or disable HTTPS for a site using a locally-trusted mkcert certificate — `action`: `enable` / `disable` |
| `xdebug` | Manage Xdebug for a PHP version — `action`: `on` / `off` / `status`. `on` accepts optional `mode` (default `debug`; accepts `coverage`, `develop`, `profile`, `trace`, `gcstats`, or comma combos like `debug,coverage`); `status` reports state and active mode for all PHP versions |
| `service_control` | Service lifecycle: `action` is `start` / `stop` / `restart` / `pin` / `unpin` / `update` / `rollback` / `migrate` / `remove`. `update` accepts an optional `tag` for an explicit upgrade target. `migrate` requires `tag` and runs the SQL dump+restore flow (mysql / postgres only). `rollback` swaps to the previously-running image (toggles). Starting/stopping respects `depends_on` cascades. |
| `service_check_updates` | Check the registry for newer images. `latest_tag` is the safe in-strategy update; `upgrade_tag` is the cross-strategy (cross-minor) target. Omit `name` to scan every active default service in one call. |
| `service_add` | Register a new custom OCI-based service (MongoDB, RabbitMQ, etc.); supports `depends_on` for service dependencies |
| `service_expose` | Add or remove an extra published port on a built-in service (persisted, auto-restarts if running) |
| `service_env` | Return the recommended `.env` connection variables for a built-in or custom service |
| `service_config` | Read / write / restore / reset / list_backups for a service's runtime tuning override. `action` defaults to `read`. `write` takes `content` and optional `backup`. `restore` takes optional `backup_name` (newest by default). `reset` writes the bundled template and stages an implicit recovery backup. Works for built-in mysql/mariadb/redis and any custom service that declares a `tuning:` block in its YAML. |
| `db_export` | Export a database to a SQL dump file (defaults to site DB from `.env`) |
| `db_import` | Import a SQL dump file into the project database (reads connection from `.env`) |
| `db_create` | Create a database and `_testing` variant for the project (infers name from `.env` or project dir) |
| `db_snapshot` | Create a named, restorable snapshot of the project database (`all_databases` covers the whole service) |
| `db_snapshots` | List stored database snapshots (`all` spans every database on the service) |
| `db_restore` | Restore the project database from a stored snapshot (destructive: drops and recreates the database) |
| `db_snapshot_delete` | Delete a stored database snapshot |
| `db_move` | Move sites' databases between two installed same-family services (`from` → `to`) and repoint each site's `.env`; pass `sites` or `all`. Source data is left intact |
| `queue` | Start or stop the queue worker for a site — `action`: `start` / `stop` (any framework with a `queue` worker) |
| `horizon` | Start or stop Laravel Horizon for a site — `action`: `start` / `stop` (use instead of `queue` when `laravel/horizon` is installed) |
| `reverb` | Start or stop the Reverb WebSocket server for a site — `action`: `start` / `stop` |
| `schedule` | Start or stop the task scheduler for a site — `action`: `start` / `stop` |
| `worker` | Start or stop any named framework worker (e.g. `messenger`, `pulse`) — `action`: `start` / `stop`. Accepts an optional `branch` to target a per-worktree unit (e.g. `vite` on `feat-a`) instead of the parent site's worker |
| `worker_list` | List all workers defined for a site's framework with running status. Accepts an optional `branch` so worktree-scoped runtime can be inspected separately from the parent |
| `commands_list` | List one-shot framework commands available for a site (resolved from framework yaml + `.lerd.yaml`). Same set the dashboard dropdown and `lerd run` see |
| `commands_run` | Execute a named command on a site (e.g. `optimize:clear`, `drush uli`, `cache:flush`). Returns combined stdout/stderr + exit code. Destructive commands (`confirm: true`) require `force: true` |
| `command_add` | Add or update a project command in `.lerd.yaml`'s `commands:` block. Same name as a framework default replaces it. Use `disabled: true` to suppress a framework default |
| `command_remove` | Remove a project command from `.lerd.yaml` by name. Does not affect framework defaults |
| `workers_mode` | Get or set the worker exec mode for a site — `action`: `get` / `set`, `mode`: `exec` (default; one container shared by all workers) or `container` (one container per worker). Used when an Octane-style runtime needs process isolation per worker |
| `workers_heal` | Restart every worker reported as failing in one pass. Mirrors the dashboard's heal-all button and the TUI `H` keybind |
| `workers_health` | Snapshot of every framework worker across every site with its running / failing state and the last error captured from journalctl, useful before deciding to heal |
| `framework_list` | List all framework definitions including their workers |
| `framework_add` | Add or update a framework definition; use `name: "laravel"` to add custom workers to Laravel |
| `framework_remove` | Remove a user-defined framework; for `laravel` removes only custom worker additions |
| `site_php` | Change the PHP version for a registered site: writes `.php-version`, updates registry, regenerates nginx vhost. Accepts an optional `branch` to override the worktree's PHP version without touching the parent |
| `site_node` | Change the Node.js version for a registered site: writes `.node-version`, installs via fnm if needed. Accepts an optional `branch` to set the version per worktree |
| `site_control` | Pause, unpause, restart, or rebuild a site — `action`: `pause` / `unpause` / `restart` / `rebuild` (pause replaces vhost with landing page; rebuild only for custom containers) |
| `site_runtime` | Switch between shared PHP-FPM and per-site FrankenPHP runtime; supports framework-aware worker mode (Laravel Octane, Symfony runtime) |
| `stripe` | Start or stop a Stripe webhook listener for a site — `action`: `start` / `stop` (reads `STRIPE_SECRET` from `.env` on start) |
| `logs` | Fetch container logs; defaults to current site's FPM; optionally specify nginx, service name, PHP version, or site name |
| `status` | Health snapshot of DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM containers, and the watcher; use when a site isn't loading |
| `doctor` | Full diagnostic as structured JSON: podman, systemd, DNS, ports, PHP images, config, updates; use when the user reports setup issues |
| `dns_diagnose` | Layered DNS chain walk (container, dnsmasq config, port 5300, dig at 5300, resolver hookup, interface routing, system lookup); each rung returns `status` + `hint` with a `first_failure` index pointing at the broken layer |
| `which` | Show the resolved PHP version, Node version, document root, and nginx config for the current site |
| `check` | Validate `.lerd.yaml` as structured JSON (PHP version, services, framework); returns valid/errors/warnings with per-field status |
| `dumps_status` | Report whether debug capture is enabled, with the socket path and queue depth |
| `dumps_recent` | Fetch recent debug events from the in-memory ring: `dump()`/`dd()` output, SQL queries (with bindings and timing), outgoing mail, rendered views, and Laravel jobs/cache/events/http. Filter by `site`, `branch` (isolate one git worktree), `ctx` (`fpm` / `cli`), `kind` (e.g. `query`), `since`, and `limit` |
| `analyze_queries` | N+1 and slow-query report over the captured queries, grouped per request, each finding tagged with the originating `file:line` so the assistant can fix it (e.g. add a `with()` eager-load). Debug loop: `dumps_toggle` enable → `dumps_clear` → hit the page/job → `analyze_queries`. Optional `site`, `min_repeat` (N+1 threshold, default 3), `slow_ms` (default 100) |
| `dumps_clear` | Drop every event from the ring so the dashboard, TUI, and CLI viewers start fresh |
| `dumps_toggle` | Enable or disable debug capture — `enable`: `true` / `false`. One switch arms both the debug bridge and the `lerd_devtools` collector (queries, mail, views, events, jobs, http); restart-free (touches a shared sentinel the bridge and extension read per request) |
| `bug_report` | Generate a structured bug report bundle (system info, lerd version, podman state, recent logs) so the assistant can paste a single block into a GitHub issue |
