## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Default services as YAML presets**. The 6 built-in services (mysql, postgres, redis, meilisearch, rustfs, mailpit) moved out of hardcoded Go lists/maps/embedded `.container` templates into `internal/config/presets/*.yaml` files marked `default: true`. Adding or replacing a default service is now a YAML edit. The same code path serves default and add-on presets — one quadlet writer, one env-var resolver, one dependency engine. Six duplicated service-name lists collapsed into `config.DefaultPresetNames()`; three duplicated env-var maps collapsed into `config.DefaultPresetEnvVars(name)`.
- **MySQL canonical bumped to 8.4 LTS** (was 8.0). Existing users on saved 8.0 are untouched (viper merge wins; `migrateStaleServiceImages` skipped for `track_latest` presets); fresh installs land on 8.4.x. 5.6 alternate removed; 5.7 and 8.0 remain pickable. `mysql.cnf` `loose-` prefixes added so the same config file works across mysql 5.6 / 5.7 / 8.0 / 8.4 (8.4 hard-rejects `innodb_large_prefix` / `innodb_file_format` without the prefix).
- **Update / Upgrade / Migrate / Rollback flow**. `serviceops.UpdateServiceStreaming`, `serviceops.MigrateService`, `serviceops.RollbackService` plus a new `internal/registry` package querying Docker Hub and GHCR for newer tags. Per-preset `update_strategy` (`patch` / `minor` / `rolling` / `none`), `track_latest` (fresh installs resolve current upstream), and `allow_major_upgrade` (gates cross-major NewestStable).
  - **CLI**: `lerd service update <name> [tag]`, `lerd service migrate <name> <tag>`, `lerd service rollback <name>`. `lerd service list` gains an Update column with green / amber badges showing pending updates.
  - **Web UI**: green Update, amber Upgrade, violet Migrate (mysql / postgres / mariadb only), grey Rollback buttons in the service detail panel. Streaming NDJSON phase events into the existing in-flight UI machinery.
  - **MCP**: `service_check_updates` for read-only status; `service_control` extended with `update`, `migrate`, `rollback`, `restart`, `remove` actions on top of the existing lifecycle ones. `service_remove` and `service_update` removed as standalone tools — folded into `service_control` action enum.
- **Migration safety guards**. Rolling-tag updates suppressed when local manifest digest matches remote (no phantom badges on `:latest`). Cross-major upgrades hidden from the Upgrade button by default; opt-in via per-preset `allow_major_upgrade`. Cross-strategy upgrade button suppressed for `update_strategy: patch` presets without a registered SQL migrator (Meilisearch — clicking would brick the data dir). Alternates installed via preset (e.g. `mysql-8-0`) internally promote to `patch` strategy so they don't get auto-suggested cross-LTS jumps.
- **`internal/registry` package**. `ListTags`, `MaybeNewerTag`, `NewestStable` against Docker Hub and GHCR with a 6-hour disk cache. Typed `*UnreachableErr` and `*UnsupportedRegistryErr` are swallowed by the high-level helpers so offline / unsupported-registry installs stay quiet rather than spamming errors.
- **`/api/services/<name>/{updates,update,rollback,migrate}`**. Read JSON + streaming NDJSON endpoints mirroring the existing preset-install streaming flow.

### Changed

- **Dashboard rewritten in Svelte + TypeScript**. The web UI has been rebuilt from scratch in Svelte 5 with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin. The previous 4,800-line Alpine.js monolith (`internal/ui/index.html`) has been removed. The new build lives under `internal/ui/web/` as small composable components per tab, stores, and modals. Every feature from the Alpine version is preserved: Sites/Services/System tabs, per-site controls, worktree list, domain-management modal, link-site modal, preset install modal with NDJSON phase progress, LAN exposure flow with progress modal and remote-setup code generator, remote dashboard access flow, service dashboard iframe overlay, mobile bottom nav with a dedicated Apps page for dashboard services, offline PWA. Bundle ships as a single hashed JS + CSS file embedded into the Go binary (≈60 KB gzipped JS, 7 KB gzipped CSS). Vite build runs before `go build` via `make build-ui`; `make test-all` runs the new Vitest suite alongside the existing Go tests and bats installer tests. No backend or API changes were made; the WebSocket snapshot protocol and all `/api/*` routes are identical. The service worker's version stamp is still baked from the build metadata so cache invalidation happens on every update.
- **Web UI cache poll backs off when the desktop session is idle or locked** (#255). The `podman ps` cache that drives the dashboard already drops from 15 s to 60 s when no tab is visible. It now also drops to 60 s while at least one tab is visible but systemd-logind reports the session as idle or locked, so a focused tab on an unattended laptop stops paying the per-15 s subprocess cost. Recomputes on every transition via a 30 s logind poll. Linux only; macOS keeps the visibility-only behavior via the existing `SessionIsIdleOrLocked` stub.
- `lerd service restart` now refreshes the quadlet before restarting (same path as `start`), so config edits and preset file mounts (mysql `lerd.cnf`) land on disk before the unit picks them up. Previously a stale quadlet from an earlier release could keep running until an explicit stop+start.
- `internal/podman/quadlets/lerd-{mysql,redis,postgres,meilisearch,rustfs,mailpit}.container` deleted — quadlets are now generated from preset YAML on demand. `internal/cli/service_image_{darwin,linux}.go` deleted — platform image overrides moved into `Preset.PlatformOverrides` with optional `{{tag}}` template substitution so `track_latest`-resolved tags survive the platform swap.
- `applyServices` in the Web UI now refreshes every server-supplied field on each WS push (was only `status` / `pinned` / `site_count`), so update / upgrade / version state propagates over the socket without a page reload. Client-only flags (`loading`, `error`, `flash`) still survive across pushes for in-flight UI state.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent update / migrate / rollback now serialised per service** (`internal/serviceops/locks.go`). Double-clicking the Update button, or a CLI run racing the dashboard, can no longer interleave config writes, image pulls and data-dir swaps.
- **`persistImageChoice` and `swapImagePin` are now atomic with quadlet regeneration**. If the on-disk quadlet write fails after the config write, the config is rolled back so `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml` and the generated `.container` file can't disagree. Joined-error output if the rollback itself fails.
- **Migrate failures now restore the pre-migrate data dir.** A new `abortMigrate` helper bubbles errors from `restoreDataDirFromBackup` (was `_ = restoreDataDirFromBackup(...)`) and restarts the old unit when appropriate.
- **Rollback after a Migrate is refused.** New `LastOp` and `PreMigrateBackup` fields on `ServiceConfig` / `CustomService`. `RollbackService` errors out when the last op was a migrate (running the old binary against the upgraded data dir would corrupt it). The dashboard hides the Rollback button via the new `can_rollback` field on `/api/services`.
- **SQL dump credentials no longer leak through argv.** `mysqldump` and `pg_dumpall` receive `MYSQL_PWD` / `PGPASSWORD` via `podman exec --env`, not on the command line. Dump files now open with mode `0600`; the backups directory is `0700`.
- **30-minute timeout on every in-container migrate exec.** A wedged container can no longer block migrate forever; `containerExec` / `dumpToHost` / `restoreFromHost` use `exec.CommandContext` with a hard cap.
- **`allow_major_upgrade` is enforced even when the CLI passes a tag explicitly.** A new `enforceMajorUpgradeGate` check refuses `lerd service update mysql 9.0` for presets where `allow_major_upgrade: false`. The registry-recommendation gate could previously be bypassed by direct tag invocation.
- **Server-side NDJSON streams stop on client disconnect.** A new `startNDJSONStream` helper short-circuits writes once `r.Context()` is cancelled or `w.Write` returns an error, replacing four copies of the `_, _ = w.Write(...)` closure in update / migrate / rollback / preset-install handlers.
- **Client surfaces stream errors instead of freezing the spinner.** `streamServiceAction` now calls `setProgress` with phase `error` before continuing, so a failed update shows the message in the UI instead of leaving the inline status stuck on the last visible phase.
- **Update-button gate uses strict equality.** `migration_supported === false` / `=== true` and `can_rollback !== false` so a missing field doesn't accidentally show the wrong button. JSON tags lose `omitempty` on those bool fields so the false case is always wire-visible.
- **`lerd service restart` warns instead of failing when quadlet regeneration trips.** A transient template error (e.g. a malformed env var) no longer strands a healthy unit; the restart proceeds against the existing on-disk quadlet.
- **Registry: Docker Hub pagination followed.** `dockerHubResponse.Next` was previously read but never followed; long-tail repos (postgres, mysql) lost newer tags past page 1. Capped at 20 pages and 5000 tags so a pathological response can't drive unbounded traffic.
- **Registry: distinct error classes.** New `*AuthRequiredErr` and `*NotFoundErr`. 401/403 → auth needed, 404 → repo doesn't exist, 429/5xx → unreachable. All four collapse to "no update info" via `isQuietRegistryErr` but stay distinguishable.
- **Registry: token and tag-list calls have separate timeout budgets** (15 s each). A slow GHCR token endpoint can no longer starve the subsequent tag-list request.
- **Registry: concurrent cache writes now safe.** In-process `cacheMu` plus an inline singleflight collapses concurrent `ListTags` calls; cache writes go to a temp file and `os.Rename` atomically. Cache write failures emit a rate-limited `log.Printf` instead of disappearing into `_ = os.WriteFile(...)`.
- **Registry: response body capped at 5 MB and tag list at 5000 entries** so a malicious or misconfigured registry can't OOM the process.
- **Digest comparisons normalised** (lowercase + trim) in the `alreadyOnDigest` helper so registries returning differently-cased digests don't cause a permanent "update available" badge.
- New tests: `TestRollback_RefusesAfterMigrate`, `TestCheckUpdateAvailable_CanRollback`, `TestEnforceMajorUpgradeGate`, `TestLeadingMajor`, plus registry tests for 404, 429, 5xx, pagination, and concurrent-singleflight de-duplication.

## [1.18.1] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **DNS sudoers rules use wildcards in command arguments, breaking install on strict-sudo distros** (#269, #272). Ubuntu 26.04 LTS made `sudo-rs` (the memory-safe Rust rewrite of sudo) the default; sudo-rs's parser rejects wildcards in command arguments outright. The same pattern is rejected by upstream C sudo from 1.9.16 onward, which ships on Fedora 41+, Arch / CachyOS, openSUSE Tumbleweed, and NixOS unstable. The `cp /tmp/lerd-sudo-* /etc/...` and `resolvectl <verb> *` rules lerd wrote to `/etc/sudoers.d/lerd` never matched on those parsers, so every DNS reconfigure fell through to the password-prompt path and emitted parse errors visibly during `lerd install` ("wildcards are not allowed in command arguments"). Fixed by piping content through `sudo tee <fully-qualified-path>` instead of staging in `/tmp` and copying, and by dropping the trailing `*` from the resolvectl line. The Darwin path got the same treatment so future Apple-bundled sudo updates don't surface the same break. Existing installs heal automatically on the next `lerd install`: one password prompt to migrate, then the new rules grant passwordless operation for every subsequent DNS reconfigure. Verified end-to-end on a fresh Ubuntu 26.04 LTS VM running sudo-rs 0.2.13.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **FrankenPHP runtime** (#229). Per-site `dunglas/frankenphp` container as an alternative to the shared PHP-FPM image. Laravel and Symfony adapters; `lerd runtime frankenphp` CLI and `site_runtime` MCP tool to switch; optional worker mode (Laravel Octane, Symfony's FrankenPHP adapter with `--watch`). Runtime badge shown in both the Web UI and TUI. Paused sites stop/start their per-site container alongside FPM.
- **Dual-stack IPv4 + IPv6 networking** (#230, #247). The lerd podman bridge is created with both subnets (`fd00:1e7d::/64` for v6). Nginx vhosts listen on `[::]`, dnsmasq answers AAAA for `.test`, and every managed `PublishPort` gets paired with a `[::1]` bind. Existing v4-only networks auto-migrate on the next `lerd install`: containers stop, the network is recreated, previous DNS servers are restored, and containers restart. Hosts without a usable IPv6 address (no non-loopback, non-link-local v6 on any interface) are detected via `/proc/net/if_inet6` + the `disable_ipv6` sysctl plus a throw-away aardvark probe, and the network is created (or recreated) v4-only. A marker file prevents re-entering the migration loop. See [architecture](reference/architecture.md) and [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
- **`--no-ipv6` flag and `LERD_DISABLE_IPV6=1` on `lerd install`** (#251). Force a v4-only `lerd` network on dual-stack-capable hosts without touching the host networking stack. Reuses the existing `~/.local/share/lerd/ipv6-probe-failed-lerd` marker, so `EnsureNetwork` honors the opt-out on every path. Re-enable by deleting the marker and rerunning `lerd install`.
- **Three new service presets: `memcached`, `rabbitmq`, `elasticsearch`** (#252). Standard preset convention (`lerd service preset <name>`). The `rabbitmq` preset exposes the management UI at `http://localhost:15672`; `elasticsearch` binds `127.0.0.1:9200` so the bundled `elasticvue` preset becomes a one-click install on top.
- **Streaming preset install in the Web UI** (#257). `POST /api/services/presets/{name}` returns `application/x-ndjson` with events for `installing_config`, `starting_deps`, `pulling_image`, `starting_unit`, `waiting_ready`, and `done`. The image pull is now explicit and happens before `StartUnit`, so the formerly invisible on-demand pull surfaces as live `Copying blob …` feedback. The Add button's label tracks the active phase ("Pulling image…", "Starting elasticsearch…", "Waiting for ready…") instead of one opaque "Adding…". The CLI (`lerd service preset <name>`) and the MCP `service_preset_install` tool keep their existing synchronous behavior.
- **Offline landing page for the installed PWA** (#258). A service worker ships with the dashboard and falls back to a dedicated offline page whenever `lerd-ui` is unreachable, including the whole-stack `lerd quit` case. The page shows `lerd start` with a copy button and the lerd logo, probes `/api/status` every five seconds, and auto-reloads the dashboard the moment the backend returns. `/api/*` is deliberately not intercepted so the WebSocket and every mutating call keep their normal error semantics. Cache name is versioned with the lerd build so every update invalidates the previous shell cache cleanly.
- **Service version label across every surface** (#246). `lerd service list`, `lerd status`, the Web UI service list and detail header, and the TUI services pane now show the version alongside each built-in, preset, and custom service (e.g. `mysql v8.0`, `redis v7`, `postgres v16`, `meilisearch v1.7`). Derived from the installed quadlet's `Image=` tag via `podman.ServiceVersionLabel`, which strips distro/variant suffixes (`-alpine`, `-slim`, `-3.5`), keeps leading `v`, and passes rolling tags (`latest`, `main`) through verbatim.
- **Restart button in the Web UI service detail** (#246). Built-in and custom services now expose a Restart action alongside Start/Stop, matching the site container row. `POST /api/services/{name}/restart` wraps `podman.RestartUnit` and clears the paused flag on success. Workers (queue, schedule, horizon, reverb, stripe, site-scoped custom workers) are intentionally excluded.
- **`setup` MCP tool** (#240). Runs the framework's `Default: true` bootstrap commands (Laravel: `storage:link` + `migrate`; Symfony: `doctrine:migrations:migrate` when `doctrine-migrations-bundle` is installed). Agents call it after `env_setup` on new or cloned projects; idempotent, no prompts. The interactive `lerd setup` CLI is unchanged.
- **Uninstall teardown prompts** (#235). `lerd uninstall` now prompts independently for:
  - Remove MCP integration (global skills + per-site `.claude`/`.cursor`/`.junie`/`.mcp.json` entries, preserves other MCP servers in shared files).
  - Uninstall mkcert CA from system trust stores.
  - Purge lerd-built container images (`lerd-php*-fpm:local`, `lerd-custom-*:local`, `lerd-dnsmasq:local`; upstream pulls like mysql/redis are deliberately kept, data lives in host bind mounts not in the images).
  `--force` answers yes to all.
- **`lerd install` refreshes MCP skills and heals Claude Code registration** (#235, #240). Global skill files (`~/.claude/skills/lerd/`, `~/.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc`, `~/.junie/guidelines.md`) and every opted-in site's per-project copies are re-written on install to match the new binary; previously this only ran on `lerd update`. If Claude Code's user-scope MCP config has lost the lerd entry, install also re-adds it via `claude mcp add`.
- **Stale-site auto-cleanup covers non-parked sites** (#239). The 30 second watcher sweep now removes any registered site whose directory has been deleted, not only those under `parked_directories`. Publishes a `sites` eventbus event so the dashboard reflects the removal without a manual refresh.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — slimmer MCP tool manifest** (#232). The `tools/list` response merged action pairs (`queue_start` + `queue_stop` → `queue(action: ...)`, `service_start` + `service_stop` → `service_control(action: ...)`, and similar) and trimmed long descriptions. AI sessions started against the old tool names must be restarted. The new names are reflected in the injected SKILL.md and in `docs/features/mcp.md`.
- **`project_new` runs `composer install` after scaffolding** (#240). The `create-project --no-install` scaffold is chased by `composer install` inside the FPM container, so the returned project has a populated `vendor/` ready for `env_setup` + `setup`.
- **`env_setup` auto-creates `database/database.sqlite` non-interactively** (#240). Laravel's default `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` triggered an interactive prompt in `lerd env` that MCP/script callers silently skipped, leaving the sqlite file uncreated and the first request 500'ing. Non-interactive callers now default to sqlite, persist the choice to `.lerd.yaml`, and run the existing file-creation block. Call `db_set` to switch to mysql/postgres afterwards.
- **Per-session MCP token cost reduced** (#236, #237). `tools/list` trimmed ~14% (20 KB → 17 KB), injected `SKILL.md` trimmed from 44 KB → 40 KB by collapsing redundant single-tool workflow recipes. Descriptions are preserved where weaker local LLMs rely on them (`site` fields, `path` defaulting, enum-valued descriptions).
- **SKILL.md bootstrap workflows rewritten** (#240). Replaced the per-framework `artisan migrate` / `console doctrine:migrations:migrate` fork with a framework-agnostic sequence: new project = `project_new → site_link → env_setup → setup`, cloned project = `site_link → composer install → env_setup → setup`. Debug-500 flow calls `setup()` for pending migrations.
- **Install flow starts per-site containers and stripe workers in the correct phase** (#234). `lerd install` now starts per-site custom containers and FrankenPHP runtimes after service containers, and stripe listeners fire in the worker phase instead of during `restoreSiteInfrastructure` (no more "stripe starts before FPM" out-of-order).

### Fixed

- **Aardvark-dns drift after network recreation** (#234, #240). When a network is rm'd and recreated with the same name, netavark can preserve the old listen-ips header in aardvark's runtime config, stalling every container DNS lookup ~5 seconds while glibc waits for the non-listening gateway to time out. `EnsureNetwork` now detects the drift (via `AardvarkNetworkDrifted`) and triggers a recreate; both the dual-stack migration path and `lerd uninstall`'s network teardown wipe `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/networks/aardvark-dns/<name>` between `rm` and `create` so the condition can't re-occur.
- **Custom container sites not started after `lerd install`** (#234). `install.go` now calls `startPerSiteContainers` after `startRestoredServices`, so `lerd-custom-<site>` units come up alongside FPM and global services. Previously they sat enabled-but-stopped until the user ran `lerd start`.
- **Stripe listeners started before FPM and nginx were up** (#234). `restoreSiteInfrastructure` called `StripeStartForSite` synchronously, unlike other workers which write their unit file and defer `Start` to the worker phase. New `writeStripeUnit` / `StripeRestoreUnit` split so the start fires in `startRestoredServices`'s worker phase, matching queue/schedule/reverb ordering.
- **`lerd share` collapsed https asset URLs on LAN** (#231). HTTPS sites sharing on LAN had asset URLs stripped back to HTTP by the nginx rewrite; the collapse now only fires for http assets on https pages.

### Docs

- New "Runtime" section in the commands reference covers `lerd runtime fpm|frankenphp` and its `--worker` / `--no-worker` flags.
- Laravel and Symfony getting-started pages mention FrankenPHP / Octane / Symfony Runtime as optional alternatives to the shared PHP-FPM stack.
- Herd comparison table gains a FrankenPHP / Octane row (Lerd: built-in, free; Herd: Pro-only).
- Architecture dual-stack section and the remote-development "Security caveats" list note v4-only firewall rules bypass and globally-routable v6 SLAAC LAN reach.
- Landing page: two-column hero for MCP + Rootless Podman, new Framework store and Polyglot sites cards, trimmed copy to a 4-row max; hero text scaled down to fit "Local PHP development for Linux" on one line.
- README feature list mentions FrankenPHP; MCP example updated to the post-1.18 `site_link → composer install → env_setup → setup` sequence; tool count corrected to ~50 after the #232 manifest slim.
- New troubleshooting entry for the aardvark-dns drift case (symptoms, cause, manual verification via the aardvark config file).
- Uninstall instructions now cover the three new teardown prompts and `--force` semantics.
- Lifecycle reference documents the stale-site auto-cleanup (fsnotify fast path + 30s sweep + eventbus refresh).
- `docs/features/mcp.md` tool table adds `setup` and updates example interactions to the four-step bootstrap sequence.
- Getting-started guides (laravel / symfony / wordpress) mention `setup` in the AI-assistant tip.

### CI

- Skip docs deploy and brew tap upload on pre-release tags (#233). The docs site and the Homebrew tap now track stable tags only; beta and rc tags still build binaries but don't publish.
- Scheduled `check-upstream-php` workflow now actually triggers a base-image rebuild (#256). The dispatch step ran with the default restricted `GITHUB_TOKEN` so `createWorkflowDispatch` returned `403 Resource not accessible by integration`, and the digest cache was saved before the failing trigger job, advancing the cached digests without an actual rebuild. Jobs are merged, `permissions: actions: write` is declared on the job, and the cache save is gated on dispatch success. On failure the prior cache is preserved so the next cron retries.

## [1.17.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Services not started after fresh macOS install**. `ensureServiceQuadlet` on macOS called `WriteContainerUnitFn` which only writes the launchd plist, not a `.container` file in `QuadletDir`. `startRestoredServices` later reads that directory via `quadletImage()` to decide what to pre-pull; with no file it returns empty and skips the pull, leaving `podman run` to auto-pull mysql/postgres/etc. on a brand-new Podman Machine where those pulls often fail or time out. Switched to `WriteQuadletDiff`, which writes both the `.container` file and the launchd plist via `AfterQuadletWriteFn`, so pre-pull works on first install.
- **PHP FPM images silently missed on first install**. `ensureFPMQuadletTo` wrote the launchd plist only after a successful image build; a failed build left the PHP version unregistered, invisible to `ensureImages()`, and never retried. The plist is now written before the build so the version shows up in `lerd status` (as `image missing`) and `lerd start` rebuilds it on the next run. `lerd install`'s autostart block also re-runs `ensureImages()` before starting FPM containers so transient build failures heal automatically.
- **Image pulls routed through lerd-dns on macOS install**. `ensureImages()` ran after `ConfigureResolver()`, so every registry pull (nginx, DNS, services, FPM) went through the `.test` override. Moved the call before the DNS block so pulls use the clean system resolver.
- **`.container` file missing for service and custom-container units on macOS**. All call sites (FPM, custom services, custom containers, UI server, MCP server) used `WriteContainerUnitFn`, which on macOS writes only the launchd plist. `quadletImage()` then had no file to read, so the pre-pull step was skipped and containers failed on first start. Every site now calls `WriteQuadletDiff`, which writes both artifacts.
- **Certificates reissued on every `lerd setup`**. `IssueCert` re-ran mkcert even when the cert and key were already present. Now skips when both files exist.
- **Shims broken under Homebrew installs**. php/composer/laravel shims hardcoded `~/.local/bin/lerd` as the target binary, so they failed for Homebrew installs at `/opt/homebrew/bin/lerd`. Shims now resolve the running binary with `os.Executable()` and use whichever path ran `lerd install`.
- **PHP commands failing on fresh installs because `.env` services weren't running**. `ensureServicesForCwd` only acted on paused sites, so mysql/postgres/etc. referenced in a site's `.env` stayed down and migrations failed with connection errors. It now starts any referenced service that isn't running, silently, regardless of pause state.
- **Dashboard preset install left services stopped**. `InstallPresetByName` only wrote the quadlet without starting the container, so services added from the Web UI (mongodb and others) sat idle after install. The UI now starts dependencies and then the service itself, matching the dashboard's Start button.
- **`lerd share` URL unreachable while a VPN is active**. `detectPrimaryLANIP` returned the VPN tunnel address (`utun*`/`tun*`) instead of the physical LAN interface, so the shared URL worked on the host but nothing else on the LAN could reach it. The detector now validates which interface the routing-table probe selected and falls back to scanning physical interfaces, skipping `utun`, `tun`, `tap`, `wg`, and container bridges.
- **fnm install fails on ARM Linux**. The installer only fetched `fnm-linux.zip`, which is x86_64-only; arm64 machines need `fnm-arm64.zip`. Arch detection now picks the correct archive, matching the existing logic used for mkcert.
- **Go test runs hang for the full timeout**. `installCompletion` called `os.Executable()` during tests; the resulting path pointed at the test binary, which then re-invoked itself with `completion bash` and hung until CI's 10-minute timeout. The installer now skips when the executable name ends in `.test`.

---

## [1.17.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Nginx per-site overrides** (#225). User snippets dropped in `~/.local/share/lerd/nginx/custom.d/{domain}.conf` now survive every vhost regeneration and every `lerd update`. Each generated server block ends with an `include` that pulls that file in, and lerd never writes into `custom.d/` so your edits stay put. Fixes #223.
- **X-Forwarded-* propagation into PHP** (#225). Generated vhosts now set `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_NAME`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT`, `HTTP_X_REAL_IP`, and `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` via two http-level `map` blocks (`$real_forwarded_host`, `$real_forwarded_proto`) declared once in a new `conf.d/_forwarded.conf`. Direct browser access is unchanged because the maps fall back to `$host` and `$scheme`; tunnels like `lerd share`, ngrok, and cloudflared now produce correct absolute URLs out of the box, without any app-side `trust_proxies` config. Fixes #224.
- **Global AI skill docs refreshed on `lerd update`** (#222). `mcp:enable-global` now also writes user-scope `SKILL.md`, cursor rules, and junie guidelines so AI assistants know about the current lerd MCP tools. `lerd update` rewrites those three files from the new binary whenever global MCP is enabled, keeping them aligned with any added or renamed tools. The gate detects both Claude user-scope registration and the lerd-owned marker files, so users without Claude Code installed are still covered.
- **TUI responsive layout, scrollbars, and color refresh** (#217). Below 100 columns the dashboard stacks into a narrow layout: list pane (40%) above detail (60%), `v` toggles between sites and services, `tab` cycles only through the active list and detail. Sites, services, and the site detail pane gained a scrollbar; the log pane is scrollable with `{` and `}` and its header shows the current offset. Colors were rebalanced to match the web UI palette: emerald for running, violet for accents, amber for paused, red for failing.

### Fixed

- **Country-code TLDs incorrectly encoded in auto-generated site names** (#221). `SiteNameAndDomain` used a curated TLD list that missed most ccTLDs, so a directory named `astrolov.ro` produced `astrolov-ro.test` instead of `astrolov.test`. Replaced with a regex matching any trailing two-letter suffix, covering every ISO 3166 code without a maintenance list. Multi-letter gTLDs (`.com`, `.net`, `.info`, `.dev`, `.app`, `.ltd`, and friends) stay on the curated list so `app.v2` and `backup.old` survive unchanged.
- **Invalid `AWS_BUCKET` names on rustfs sites** (#220). The framework template wrote the underscored database handle, which rustfs rejects. `envMap["AWS_BUCKET"]` now flows through `s3BucketName` on every run so stale invalid values auto-heal, and a new `{{bucket}}` template placeholder resolves to the S3-safe form. Existing sites with a broken bucket name are repaired on the next `lerd env`.
- **Auto-stop skipped Podman services on macOS after all sites were paused** (#216). Services using Podman's `--restart=always` policy sit with a launchd plist in the "not running, never exited" state; `UnitStatus` fell through to `ContainerRunning`, but a transient `podman inspect` failure (common under VM socket contention) returned "failed" and auto-stop silently skipped the service. `ContainerRunning` is now the authoritative check, with `UnitStatus` kept as a fallback when the container is not found. Postgres and meilisearch now stop as expected.

### Changed

- **Docs workflow deploys only on tag release** (#219). The GitHub Pages deploy now triggers on `v*` tag pushes instead of every push to main, so the published site tracks tagged versions and doesn't republish on internal-only merges.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **`lerd tui` — terminal dashboard**. A btop-style, full-screen dashboard for sites, services, and workers, with near parity to the [Web UI](/features/web-ui) and [System Tray](/features/system-tray). Built on the same bubbletea / lipgloss stack already used for `lerd man` and the same `siteinfo` / `podman.Cache` / eventbus plumbing that drives `lerd-ui`, so both surfaces see identical live state.
  - **Layout**: Sites + Services stacked in the left column, a full-height Site detail pane on the right, and a toggleable log tail below (`l`). Header shows DNS / nginx / FPM status plus an `update: vX.Y.Z` banner when a newer release is cached.
  - **Site detail**: primary domain header, internal name, disk path, full domains list (add with `a`, rename with `e`, remove with `x`), services-used with live state, workers (toggle with `space`), git worktrees, HTTPS toggle, LAN share toggle (shows `http://<lan-ip>:<port>` when on), PHP and Node version pickers (open with `space`, commit with `enter`, backed by `lerd isolate` / `lerd isolate:node`).
  - **Services pane** includes site-owned workers (`queue-<site>`, `schedule-<site>`, `horizon-<site>`, `reverb-<site>`, custom framework workers), routed through `lerd queue start/stop`, `lerd worker start/stop <name>`, etc. `t` opens an interactive shell in the focused container (FPM or custom for sites, the service container for services, the owning site's FPM for workers).
  - **Filter + sort**: `/` to filter sites / services by name (sites also match domains and framework label), `o` to cycle sort (sites: name · status · framework; services: name · status · usage). `v` hides the services pane.
  - **Log sources**: `[` / `]` cycle through FPM / custom container, every worker journal (`journalctl --user -u lerd-<kind>-<site>`), and every file matched by the framework's `fw.Logs` globs (Laravel: `storage/logs/*.log`). Logs pane takes at least half the window and has a right-edge scrollbar.
  - **In-pane overlays**: `S` swaps the detail pane for global Settings (LAN expose, autostart on login, Xdebug per PHP version) and moves focus into it; `?` swaps it for a scrollable Keybindings reference. `esc` returns to Site detail.
  - Updates live by subscribing to the in-process eventbus and re-querying every 2 s so changes made from another terminal surface within a couple of seconds.

- **Selectable Xdebug mode per PHP version** (#205). `lerd xdebug on` now accepts `--mode` (`debug`, `coverage`, `profile`, `trace`, `develop`, `gcstats`, or comma combos like `debug,coverage`); previously mode was hardcoded to `debug`. The dashboard gains a mode dropdown next to the Xdebug toggle and a clickable Xdebug chip on each site row. The MCP `xdebug_on` tool accepts a `mode` argument. Toggle orchestration (validate → persist → write ini → restart FPM) is extracted into a new `xdebugops` package; the three surfaces (CLI, UI, MCP) are now thin wrappers. Legacy configs with no saved mode resolve to `debug` so existing setups are unaffected.

- **Adaptive Podman Machine memory on macOS** (#206). The VM memory target now scales with host RAM instead of a fixed 4 GB floor: 3 GB on machines with ≤8 GB, 4 GB on 9–31 GB, 6 GB on 32 GB+. Detection uses `sysctl hw.memsize`; falls back to 4 GB when detection fails. On 8 GB MacBooks lerd prints a note with the manual override command (`podman machine set --memory 4096`) so the tradeoff is visible.

- **`lerd quit` stops the Podman Machine VM on macOS**. After all containers, workers, the Web UI, watcher, and tray are shut down, `lerd quit` calls `podman machine stop` on any running machine. `lerd start` already starts the machine, so quit and start are now fully symmetric. No change on Linux where Podman runs natively without a VM.

### Fixed

- **Worker log tabs stuck on "connecting..." in the dashboard** (#210). Two separate bugs combined. First, silent units (no output until an event fires) never triggered the first body write, so Go's `http.ResponseWriter` never sent the HTTP 200 + `text/event-stream` headers and the browser's `EventSource` stayed in `CONNECTING`. Fixed by flushing a `: connected` SSE comment immediately after writing headers. Second, switching tabs opened a new `EventSource` without closing the previous one; after a few clicks all six browser HTTP/1.1 connections were consumed and new streams queued indefinitely. Fixed by closing every non-active worker log stream before opening the new one.

- **Git worktrees running stale code from the main checkout** (#209). `vendor/` and `node_modules/` in a new worktree were symlinks back to the main repo. PHP resolves `__DIR__` through symlinks, so `vendor/autoload.php` reported the main repo path and Composer's `ClassLoader` loaded every class from `main`'s source tree, silently ignoring any diverged `app/` or `src/` files in the worktree. The symlinks are now replaced with real copies seeded from the main repo using reflink-aware helpers (`cp -a --reflink=auto` on Linux btrfs/xfs, `cp -Rc` on macOS APFS, plain Go walk elsewhere), followed by `composer install` and `npm ci` to reconcile against the worktree's own lockfiles.

---

## [1.15.1] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **`lerd.localhost` 504 on rootless Linux**. The dashboard vhost reverse-proxied to `host.containers.internal:7073`, which on rootless podman setups where netavark resolves that name to `169.254.1.2` but doesn't wire up a bridge alias or DNAT for it routed packets into a dead end, and the proxy hop timed out after 60 seconds. `lerd-ui` now also binds a unix domain socket at `~/.local/share/lerd/run/lerd-ui.sock`, the `lerd-nginx` quadlet bind-mounts that path read-write, and the Linux vhost `proxy_pass`es through `http://unix:...` instead of TCP. Unix sockets depend on filesystem access, not container networking, so the dashboard no longer breaks when your netavark/pasta/rootless stack shifts between versions or your host changes networks. macOS keeps the TCP path via `host.containers.internal:7073` because unix sockets don't traverse the podman-machine virtio-fs boundary as functional sockets, and gvproxy reliably forwards that upstream there.
- **Xdebug times out silently on rootless Linux** (same class of bug as #186). The 1.13.1 fix replaced a hardcoded `169.254.1.2` with a dynamic `getent hosts host.containers.internal` probe but still trusted whatever netavark returned without checking it actually routed. On setups where netavark gives the same 169.254.1.2 back, the fix is a no-op and Xdebug fails with `Time-out connecting to debugging client` exactly as before. `DetectHostGatewayIP` now runs a real reachability probe: from inside `lerd-nginx`, TCP-connect to lerd-ui:7073 for each candidate (getent's answer, the host's primary LAN IP, slirp4netns's `10.0.2.2`) and use the first that opens. If nothing works, fall back to the legacy constant and surface the failure in `lerd doctor` under a new `[Container → Host connectivity]` section so users get a concrete diagnosis instead of silent retries.
- **Xdebug breaks when the laptop changes networks**. A probe at `lerd start` pins a LAN IP into `/etc/hosts`, which goes stale the moment you move from home wifi to a coffee shop or rotate DHCP. New `lerd-watcher` goroutine reprobes the host gateway on LAN change and rewrites the shared `/etc/hosts` in place, so PHP-FPM containers pick up the new address on the next `getaddrinfo` call without a container restart. Steady-state cost is near zero: a single `net.Dial("udp4", "1.1.1.1:80")` routing-table lookup per 30 s tick (never sends a packet, just reads the kernel's source IP for the default route). The expensive probe only runs when the primary LAN IP actually changes. Matters most on macOS where each `podman exec` through gvproxy costs 300 ms to 1 s, so a naive probe-every-tick design would burn 1-3 % of a core continuously on battery.
- **Podman auto-creates a directory at missing bind-mount source paths**. When the FPM container starts before an ini file has been written, podman satisfies the `Volume=` clause by creating the source as a directory, and the next write against that path either silently no-ops (`EnsureUserIni` returned early on the `os.Stat` success without checking `IsDir`) or fails with `is a directory` (`WriteXdebugIni`, the inline hosts-file pre-create). Fix: `EnsureXdebugIni` and `WriteXdebugIni` detect a stale directory and remove it before writing; `EnsureUserIni` got the same self-heal; the inline hosts pre-create was extracted into `ensureFPMHostsFile` which normalises stale-directory, missing, and regular-file states into "regular file present"; `WriteContainerHosts` and `writeBrowserHosts` now `MkdirAll` their parent instead of assuming the data dir already exists. Scanned every `Volume=` source on the embedded FPM, nginx, and service quadlets to confirm these three file sources were the remaining ones needing pre-creation (directory-typed mounts like `data/*` and `conf.d` are safe because podman creating them is the right behaviour).
- **Dashboard shows containers as still running after `lerd stop`**. The in-process `AfterUnitChange` hook refreshed `podman.Cache` before broadcasting, but the `/api/internal/notify` endpoint that CLI and MCP processes use to signal unit lifecycle changes only invalidated the `siteinfo` cache and published events without refreshing the container cache. Site/FPM running flags read from `podman.Cache`, so after `lerd stop` the browser kept reporting everything as up until the 15-60 s background poller next ticked. The notify handler now also calls `podman.Cache.PollNow()` in a goroutine so state flips within a second of the CLI exiting while the handler still returns under the 500 ms POST timeout.

---

## [1.15.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Per-project custom container support** (#198). Non-PHP sites (Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, etc.) can define a `Containerfile.lerd` and a `container:` section in `.lerd.yaml`. Lerd builds a dedicated image, runs it as a named container, and nginx reverse-proxies to it. Full lifecycle: `lerd link` builds and starts, `lerd unlink` stops and cleans up (prompts to remove the image), `lerd secure`/`lerd unsecure` toggle HTTPS, `lerd pause`/`lerd unpause` stop and start the container, `lerd restart` restarts without rebuilding, `lerd rebuild` forces a fresh image build. Workers defined in `custom_workers` exec into the container. Services are reachable by name (`lerd-mysql`, `lerd-redis`, etc.) on the shared Podman network.
- **`lerd restart` command**. Restarts the container for any site type: the per-project custom container for custom sites, or the shared PHP-FPM container for PHP sites. Also available as `site_restart` MCP tool and in the dashboard (restart icon in the site header).
- **`lerd rebuild` command**. Rebuilds the custom container image from the Containerfile and restarts the container. Also available as `site_rebuild` MCP tool and `POST /api/sites/{domain}/rebuild` in the dashboard.
- **`lerd init` custom container wizard**. When no PHP project is detected (no `composer.json`, no framework) and a `Containerfile.lerd` exists, the wizard switches to custom container mode and asks for the container port, containerfile path, HTTPS, and services.
- **Containerfile MD5 caching**. `lerd link` skips the image build when the Containerfile hasn't changed since the last build. The hash is stored in `~/.local/share/lerd/container-hashes/`. `lerd rebuild` always forces a fresh build.
- **Dashboard: custom container UI**. Container icon (cube) in the sidebar, base image badge (e.g. `node:22-alpine :3000`) instead of the PHP dropdown, "Container" logs tab, restart button, worker toggles for `custom_workers`, running/stopped status reflecting the custom container.
- **`site_restart` and `site_rebuild` MCP tools**. Skill content updated with custom container architecture, `.lerd.yaml` reference including `container` and `custom_workers` fields, setup workflow, and env var configuration guidance.

### Fixed

- **Watcher overwriting custom container sites**. The site file watcher and `siteinfo.enrichVersions` no longer re-detect PHP/Node versions for custom container sites, preventing the empty values from being overwritten with defaults.
- **Parked watcher re-registering custom containers**. `RegisterProject` now skips sites already registered as custom containers.
- **Service auto-stop ignoring `.lerd.yaml`**. `CountSitesUsingService` and `sitesUsingService` now check `.lerd.yaml` services list in addition to `.env` scanning, preventing auto-stop of services used only by custom container sites.
- **Domain change producing 502**. `RegenerateSiteVhost` now uses custom container vhost templates for custom sites instead of PHP templates.
- **`lerd install`/`lerd update` overwriting custom vhosts**. The vhost regeneration during install now branches for custom container sites.
- **`lerd start`/`lerd stop` trying to start/stop workers for ignored sites**. `registeredFrameworkWorkerUnits` now skips ignored and paused sites.
- **`lerd pause`/`lerd unpause` not stopping/starting custom containers**. Pause now stops the custom container, unpause starts it and restores the proxy vhost.

---

## [1.14.1] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **Node version dropdown missing from site rows in the dashboard**. The 1.14.0 `node_managed_by_lerd` gate was implemented as an outer `<template x-if>` wrapping two inner templates (empty-list placeholder and populated `<select>`). Alpine.js's `x-if` directive only renders a single child element, so the outer template silently rendered nothing and the Node dropdown disappeared for every site, even on machines where lerd manages Node. Flattened into two sibling templates that each include the `node_managed_by_lerd` condition inline, matching the existing PHP dropdown pattern.

---

## [1.14.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Node version management** (#191). Lerd now detects whether Node is managed by the system (distro package, nvm, fnm, mise, asdf, volta) or by lerd itself, and adapts the UI and init wizard accordingly. On machines where Node is system-managed, the dashboard shows a "system" badge next to the Node.js sidebar section, hides the per-site Node version dropdown, and the `lerd init` wizard omits the Node version input (an existing `node_version` in `.lerd.yaml` is preserved). The status API gains `node_managed_by_lerd`. Also fixes a UI regression where installing Node from the dashboard could emit a spurious "unknown version" error.
- **Decoupled `lerd db:*` commands** (#192). `lerd db:import`, `db:export`, `db:create`, and `db:shell` now work in any project type (NestJS, Next.js, Go, Rails, etc.) without requiring a linked site or PHP-style `.env`. Resolution chain (first match wins): `--service` flag, `.lerd.yaml db:` block, framework detect rules, then generic `.env` inference (`DB_CONNECTION` / `DB_TYPE` / `TYPEORM_CONNECTION` / `DATABASE_URL` / `DB_PORT`). Credentials from `.env` are intentionally ignored, because lerd always connects via `podman exec` using the container's fixed admin credentials (`postgres/lerd` or `root/lerd`), so a mismatched `DB_USERNAME=root` against a pgsql container no longer fails with `role "root" does not exist`. `db:shell` now checks whether the target database exists and prompts to create it before opening the shell, instead of dumping a raw psql error.

### Changed

- **Skip `.env` backup when lerd has already written the file** (#193). `lerd env` used to unconditionally copy `.env` to `.env.before_lerd` on first run, which could overwrite a legitimate user backup if lerd had previously rewritten the file. The backup is now skipped when lerd has already written `.env` in this project, so `.env.before_lerd` always reflects the user's pre-lerd state.
- **Tray improvements** (#194). The tray "Open Dashboard" entry now opens the dashboard in the default browser, the update prompt wording is clearer, and "Quit" now stops the full lerd-ui + daemon stack instead of just dismissing the tray.

---

## [1.13.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Xdebug and inter-site HTTP inside PHP-FPM containers** (closes #186). The shared `/etc/hosts` bind-mounted into every PHP-FPM container used to hardcode `169.254.1.2` both for `host.containers.internal` and for every linked `.test` domain. That address is only a valid host gateway on rootless podman with pasta/netavark/slirp4netns, so Xdebug timed out connecting back to the IDE on other podman configurations. It also routed inter-site HTTP through a fragile `FPM → pasta host-loopback → host 127.0.0.1:80 (rootlessport) → lerd-nginx` chain that failed on some podman versions and surfaced as 504s during debugging. `WriteContainerHosts` now probes the real host gateway by exec-ing `getent hosts host.containers.internal` inside `lerd-nginx`, with a throwaway alpine container on the lerd network as fallback, and the old constant as a final fallback. Two distinct IPs are written: `host.containers.internal` points at the detected host gateway for Xdebug and any host-side tooling, while every `.test` domain resolves straight to `lerd-nginx`'s bridge IP so inter-site HTTP travels container-to-container over the lerd network without any pasta hop. Rendering was extracted into a pure `renderContainerHosts` helper with table-driven unit tests covering empty registries, nginx IP wiring, IP separation regressions, and loopback preservation.

---

## [1.13.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **`lerd lan:share` / `lerd lan:unshare`** — expose a single site to other devices on the local network at a stable `http://IP:PORT` URL with no client-side DNS setup. A host-level reverse proxy runs in the lerd-ui daemon, rewriting the `Host` header so nginx routes to the correct vhost and rewriting absolute URLs (`https://domain` → `http://LAN-IP:port`) in HTML, CSS, and JS bodies so assets and redirects work without DNS. `Accept-Encoding: identity` is forced upstream and gzip is decoded in `ModifyResponse` to keep body rewriting reliable, and `Location` headers are rewritten on redirects. Each site gets a stable port from 9100 onwards (saved in `sites.yaml`, restored on daemon start) that avoids conflicts with Reverb and other services. The CLI prints a compact half-block Unicode QR code after sharing; the dashboard UI adds a LAN toggle next to HTTPS with the URL inline and a fixed-positioned QR tooltip on hover (fixed positioning escapes `overflow-x-auto` clipping on parents). QR PNGs are served from `/api/lan-qr/{domain}`. Closes #179.
- **`lerd import sail` (alias `lerd sail import`)** — migrate an existing Laravel Sail project into lerd without manual dump/restore. Detects Docker or Podman Compose, remaps conflicting ports and strips non-data service ports so Sail starts cleanly alongside lerd, waits for the database, auto-detects the Sail DB name (handles the case where `lerd env` already overwrote `DB_DATABASE`), dumps the DB from the Sail container into lerd's MySQL/PostgreSQL, reads MinIO credentials from the compose `environment` block, and mirrors the bucket into RustFS via `mc`. Tears Sail back down when done (`--no-stop` keeps it running). `lerd env` now backs up `.env` → `.env.before_lerd` on first run and `lerd env:restore` brings it back. `lerd link` detects `laravel/sail` in `composer.json` and prompts to run the import before setup, passing `DB_DATABASE` through automatically.
- **Hardcoded bundled preset files (`preset_files.go`)** — preset file mounts (phpmyadmin config, etc.) ship inside the Go binary instead of being copied into `~/.config/lerd/services/*.yaml`, so `lerd` updates roll out new preset contents on the next service start without `remove + reinstall`. Legacy `files:` entries in user yaml are auto-stripped and re-saved on load. Newlines and NUL bytes in custom service env values are now rejected to close a quadlet `Environment=` injection vector.
- **URL hash routing in the dashboard** — `#sites/<domain>`, `#services/<name>`, `#system/<section>`, `#service/<name>` (dashboard iframe), and `#docs` are now deep-linkable with working back/forward navigation. `loadSites` auto-select only fires when the `sites` tab is active and the hash doesn't already claim an iframe view, so refreshing on a sub-page stays put.
- **`repeat_family` dynamic_env directive** — produces N copies of a value aligned with the host list from `discover_family`, used for `PMA_USERS` / `PMA_PASSWORDS` so phpmyadmin can pre-auth against every database in a family.
- **GitHub star nudge** — low-key prompt added to the installer and dashboard.

### Fixed

- **Service dashboards rendered broken inside the iframe overlay** — phpmyadmin lost session cookies across the cross-origin iframe and pgadmin's list-databases XHR dropped cookies after the initial connect. The phpmyadmin preset now rebuilds `cfg['Servers']` from `PMA_HOSTS` / `PMA_USERS` / `PMA_PASSWORDS` with `auth_type=config` for multi-host auto-login and sets `CookieSameSite=None` plus forced HTTPS env so cookies flow inside the iframe. The pgadmin preset sets `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=None` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` for the same reason. Rustfs now starts with `--console-enable` and the dashboard URL points at `/rustfs/console/` so the iframe lands on the web UI instead of the raw S3 XML. The preset picker also hides presets with unmet dependencies (mongo-express disappears until mongo is installed) instead of just disabling the install button.
- **Lerd-ui spawned terminals died silently when started at boot** — when lerd-ui runs as a lingering systemd user service it starts before the compositor exists and inherits an empty graphical environment (no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` / `DISPLAY`), so any GUI terminal it forked exited immediately. Clicking site Terminal or "Open terminal & update" did nothing with no visible error. `graphicalEnv()` now pulls the graphical vars from `systemctl --user show-environment` and probes `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` for a `wayland-*` socket as a last resort, so spawned terminals can always reach the compositor regardless of how lerd-ui itself was launched. Darwin is skipped because `open -a Terminal` reattaches to the Aqua session on its own.
- **PHP-FPM subdomain detection** — `SERVER_NAME` is now set to `$host` in PHP-FPM vhosts so subdomain routing works correctly under nginx.
- **Mobile dashboard layout broken by the iframe overlay** — the dashboard iframe assumed the desktop left rail was always visible and extended full-height, hiding the mobile bottom nav, and dashboard service icons only existed in the desktop rail so mobile users had no way to reach them. The overlay now spans full width on mobile and stops above the nav, the mobile bottom nav gains a scrollable dashboards group with a separator, the nav is pinned to `h-16` to match the iframe's reserved offset, the docs sidebar link reuses the iframe trigger, and the bottom nav is flattened so built-in tabs and dashboard services share equal width instead of each group claiming half the bar.
- **`lerd man` indexed `node_modules` when walking docs** — the docs FS walker now skips `node_modules` so man-page generation no longer drags vendor directories into the index.
- **VitePress build broken on <code v-pre>{{.Resources.Memory}}</code>** — Vue's compiler parses interpolations even inside backtick code spans, and the leading dot fails JS expression parsing. The token is now wrapped in an explicit `<code v-pre>` element so Vue skips it.

---

## [1.12.6] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Background container state cache** — a single goroutine polls `podman ps -a --filter name=lerd-` on a 15 s (focused tab) / 60 s (idle) cadence and serves every hot path (`buildStatus`, siteinfo, `IsActive`, `/api/sites`, `/api/services`, `/api/status`) from an in-memory snapshot instead of spawning a `podman inspect` subprocess per container per request. Snapshot rebuilds are serialised with a `TryLock` so concurrent requests share the in-flight build rather than each triggering their own batch. Browser Page Visibility is piped over the WebSocket so the server downshifts cache polling when every tab is hidden. The tray poller drops from 5 s to 30 s. Net effect on macOS: the idle VM no longer burns 30–80 % host CPU from repeated `podman machine ssh` round-trips.

### Fixed

- **UI Stop button hung for a minute on slow-stopping services** — stopping Selenium (or any custom service using `supervisord`/Chromium) from the web UI would leave the button spinning for 30–60 s while systemctl waited on the container's graceful shutdown. Custom service quadlets now emit `StopTimeout=5` so podman `SIGKILL`s after 5 s, matching the existing `--stop-timeout=5` behaviour on macOS. The UI `toggleService` handler also wraps the POST in an 8 s `AbortController` timeout and shows "Stopping in background…" on abort, so the button always releases promptly and the WebSocket snapshot push backfills the final state. Existing installs of affected services can pick up the new timeout with `lerd service remove <name> && lerd service preset <name>`.
- **Worker entries clobbered on `lerd uninstall` → `lerd install`** — `WorkerStartForSite` called `SetProjectWorkers(CollectRunningWorkerNames(...))`, which fully replaced the `.lerd.yaml` workers list on every invocation. Workers started sequentially during `lerd setup` overwrote each other's entries, so after an uninstall/install cycle only the last-started worker survived. Now uses a new additive `AddProjectWorker` helper. `StripeStartForSite` also persists `"stripe"` after a successful start so it survives the same cycle, and `lerd init` now lists `stripe` in the Workers multi-select when `STRIPE_SECRET` is present in the site's `.env`.
- **UI worker toggles visually reverted** — `AfterUnitChange` published the snapshot broadcast before the container cache had re-polled, so the first frame after toggling a worker carried the old state and the button appeared to flip back. The hook now calls `Cache.PollNow()` from a goroutine before publishing, so the broadcast always carries fresh data. The activating state is also now treated as running (not failing) for queue/schedule/reverb/horizon and generic framework workers, so the brief startup window no longer flashes a red error indicator.
- **WebSocket initial snapshot could be stale** — `handleWS` called the async `Cache.Refresh()` before assembling the first frame, meaning a freshly-opened browser could see container states from before `lerd start` ran. Replaced with the synchronous `Cache.PollNow()` so the first frame on every new connection reflects current reality, even when multiple tabs reconnect at the same time.
- **Rustfs bucket not created for Laravel projects** — `lerd env` only ran the rustfs bucket creation logic inside the fallback `knownServices` loop. Laravel projects go through `fw.Env.Services`, which skipped the branch entirely, so Dusk/Panther sites hit "bucket does not exist" errors on first upload. The bucket create/`mc anonymous set public` logic now runs on the framework service path too, honours an existing `AWS_BUCKET` value in `.env` instead of always overwriting with the project slug, and retries up to 3 times (2 s apart) to bridge the window between the host TCP port becoming reachable and the `mc` container being able to connect over the `lerd` network.
- **Default PHP FPM was auto-stopped when unused** — `autoStopUnusedFPMs` didn't exempt `cfg.PHP.DefaultVersion`, so setting a default (e.g. 8.5) with no site explicitly referencing it would stop the container immediately after start, breaking `php`, `composer`, and `laravel new` shims. The helper now mirrors `coreUnits()` and always keeps the default version running.
- **macOS Podman Machine memory resize fired on every start** — the <code v-pre>{{.Resources.Memory}}</code> inspect template returns MiB, not bytes, but the comparison assumed bytes. Machines already at 4096 MiB tripped the condition and the CLI stopped + resized the VM on every `lerd start`. Fixed the unit handling and, while there, lengthened the readiness timeout from 90 s to 120 s with a 3 s grace period, so the post-resize restart no longer races the API socket. `ensureDefaultPHPInstalled` also now auto-builds the FPM image + writes the quadlet on the first `lerd start` after switching the configured default PHP version, so users don't have to run `lerd php install` manually.

---

## [1.12.5] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **macOS ARM64 postgres pulled an image with no ARM64 manifest** — `platformImageOverride` was applied before `svcCfg.Image` from global config, so the macOS substitute (`imresamu/postgis`) was silently overwritten by `postgis/postgis:16-3.5-alpine` on every `ensureServiceQuadlet` and `lerd install` run. The override now runs last and only when the resolved image is the known-bad upstream `postgis/postgis` + `alpine` suffix, leaving user-pinned custom images untouched. The embedded quadlet fallback also moves from `postgis:16-3.5-alpine` to `postgis:16-3.5` so fresh Linux installs get an image with an ARM64 manifest. (#175)

---

## [1.12.4] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **`pgpass` rewrite failed with permission denied** — file mounts declared with `chown: true` (e.g. pgAdmin's `/pgpass`) get re-owned to a userns-mapped uid by podman's `:U` flag. On the next materialize the host process could no longer open the file for writing and surfaced `open …/pgpass: permission denied`. `MaterializeServiceFiles` now unlinks the existing entry before writing, so a stale userns-owned file is replaced cleanly.

---

## [1.12.3] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **pgAdmin crash loop and iframe embedding** — pgAdmin now ships a mounted `config_local.py` that disables `X-Frame-Options`, `ENHANCED_COOKIE_PROTECTION`, and `WTF_CSRF_CHECK_DEFAULT`, so it renders inside the inline dashboard overlay with working sessions and preferences. Also fixes a launchd plist XML escaping bug where `'` and `"` in env var values were emitted as numeric character references that Apple's plist parser passed through literally, corrupting container env and crash-looping pgAdmin on macOS. Adds a Slonik (elephant) icon for pgAdmin in the dashboard rail. (#171)
- **UI service remove left family consumers stale** — the web UI's remove handler did not call `RegenerateFamilyConsumers`, so removing mariadb from the UI left phpMyAdmin's `PMA_HOSTS` pointing at the gone host. The UI now matches the CLI behaviour. (#172)
- **Workers showed as off on macOS while running** — `unitStatusFn` defaulted to a `systemctl`-based path that does not exist on macOS, so the UI never reflected running workers. Darwin now overrides it to use `podman.UnitStatus`, the same path `lerd status` uses. (#170)

---

## [1.12.2] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Inline dashboard iframes** — service dashboards (phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, Mailpit, RustFS, Meilisearch, Mongo Express, Selenium…) now open as a full-width overlay inside the lerd UI instead of a new browser tab. The left icon rail grows a separator followed by one stroke icon per running dashboard-exposing service, and the service detail Dashboard / Open phpMyAdmin / Open pgAdmin buttons route through the same overlay. Clicking any of the main nav icons closes it. An Open-in-new-tab escape hatch remains for dashboards that refuse framing or lose session cookies under third-party partitioning. (#168)
- **phpMyAdmin ships `AllowThirdPartyFraming`** — the phpmyadmin preset now materialises `/etc/phpmyadmin/config.user.inc.php` with `$cfg['AllowThirdPartyFraming'] = true;` so it renders inside the inline overlay. Existing installs must `lerd service remove phpmyadmin && lerd service preset phpmyadmin` after upgrading to pick up the new file mount.

---

## [1.12.1] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **macOS release pipeline and Homebrew tap** — tagged releases now build darwin amd64/arm64 binaries and publish to the `geodro/homebrew-lerd` tap. Install on macOS with `brew tap geodro/lerd && brew install lerd && lerd install`.

### Fixed

- **Short-name pulls failed on Ubuntu** — built-in service images (`mysql`, `redis`, `postgis`, `meilisearch`, `rustfs`, `mailpit`) were stored as short names and failed on distros whose `/etc/containers/registries.conf` has no unqualified-search registries. All defaults are now fully qualified with `docker.io/`, and existing configs are auto-migrated on next load.
- **Installing a preset from the UI did nothing visible** — the `/api/services/presets/` endpoint did not publish an eventbus event after a successful install, so the 2-second snapshot cache kept returning the stale services list. The frontend's immediate `loadServices()` then failed to find the new service, leaving the modal open and the dashboard unchanged. The endpoint now invalidates the cache and broadcasts over WebSocket, so the phpMyAdmin (and any other preset) install flow closes the modal, switches to the Services tab, selects the new service, and starts it.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **macOS platform support** — first-class macOS alongside Linux. Installation, DNS, autostart, start/stop (with Podman Machine), PHP version detection, UI log streaming, and service management are all platform-split. Dedicated macOS CI build and test job.
- **macOS service management** — workers UI, tray fix, parallel service start, and LAN support on macOS.
- **WebSocket live dashboard updates** — the dashboard now receives push updates over WebSocket instead of polling, cutting idle request traffic and reflecting site/worker state changes immediately. (#161)
- **Scheduled (timer-driven) framework workers** — frameworks can declare workers that run on a systemd timer instead of as long-lived processes. Timers are included in `lerd start`/`lerd stop`, surfaced in the UI, and detected via sibling `.timer` units in worker status. (#160)
- **Platform-split UI log streaming** — log tailing routes through platform-specific backends (journald on Linux, log(1) on macOS).
- **Cross-platform service management, DNS split, and CLI utilities** — foundation for multi-OS support: abstracted service layer, platform-specific DNS handling, and shared CLI helpers.

### Fixed

- **Input validation and credential handling hardened** — security audit sweep across CLI entry points and credential handling paths.
- **Scheduled-worker lifecycle** — orphan `.timer` files are now skipped and cleaned up, timer-driven workers report as active in the UI, and stopping/tearing down timer-backed workers collapses and cleans up cleanly.
- **Per-version framework resolution** — `schedule`, `queue`, `horizon`, and `reverb` shortcuts now resolve the framework definition per-version instead of falling back to a single global definition.
- **Perpetual service quadlet rewrite on install** — `lerd install` no longer rewrites service quadlets on every run, which previously dropped local edits and triggered needless restarts.
- **Skip Laravel installer prompt when already installed** — `lerd setup` no longer asks to install Laravel when the project is already initialised.
- **macOS terminal integration** — `lerd open` and the UI terminal button open Terminal.app silently at the project directory; `lerd update` defers to `brew upgrade lerd` on macOS.
- **macOS DNS sleep/wake repair, tray startup, and install ordering** — DNS survives sleep/wake cycles, the tray starts reliably on login, and install ordering avoids race conditions. Sequential install image pulls keep the sudo prompt visible.
- **Launchctl kickstart hang on tray restart** — `lerd-tray` restart no longer hangs inside `launchctl kickstart` on macOS.
- **RunParallel keypress goroutine swallowed sudo input** — the parallel-run keypress watcher no longer competes with sudo for stdin, so password prompts work again.
- **Install linger and sudo prompt UX** — `lerd install` enables systemd user linger automatically, and the linger sudo prompt renders on its own line for readability.
- **Default PHP-FPM always starts in `lerd start`** — the default PHP-FPM unit is always brought up, preventing "no PHP handler" errors on fresh boots.
- **Linux worker restore, PostGIS migration, and UI request pile-up** — hardened worker restoration on Linux, fixed PostGIS database migration, and stopped the UI from piling up in-flight requests.
- **Remote CA installed into isolated CAROOT** — `lerd setup --remote` installs its CA into a dedicated CAROOT so it no longer overwrites the local mkcert root.

### Changed

- **Platform-split installation** — binaries, DNS, autostart, and cleanup routines are now dispatched through a platform interface rather than hardcoded to Linux.
- **Platform-split start/stop** — `lerd start`/`lerd stop` run through per-platform implementations, including Podman Machine orchestration on macOS.
- **Platform-split PHP version detection** — PHP version discovery runs through platform-specific probes.

### Docs

- **macOS in the tagline and install docs** — the tagline, install instructions, and per-platform update steps now include macOS. Beta wording and "coming soon" / "Linux-only" phrasing removed throughout.

---

## [1.11.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Ptyxis terminal support** — `lerd open` and the tray menu now detect and launch Ptyxis, the GNOME 47+ terminal emulator.
- **Link → init → setup flow** — after `lerd link`, the CLI guides the user through `lerd init` and `lerd setup` when the project hasn't been initialised yet.
- **PHP version suggestion during link** — when the project requires a PHP version that isn't installed, `lerd link` suggests installing it.
- **Favicon field in framework definitions** — frameworks can now declare a custom favicon path (e.g. `core/misc/favicon.ico` for Drupal) so the dashboard shows the correct icon.

### Fixed

- **Framework detection for custom frameworks** — detection rules now read `composer.json` directly and support custom `detect` rules, fixing detection for frameworks like Drupal, CakePHP, and WordPress.
- **Worker checks and env setup for custom frameworks** — worker `check` rules and env variable setup now work correctly for non-Laravel frameworks.
- **Favicon detection uses framework public_dir** — custom frameworks with non-standard public directories (e.g. `web/` for Symfony/Drupal) now have their favicons detected correctly.
- **0-byte favicon files skipped** — empty favicon placeholder files no longer show as having a favicon in the dashboard.
- **Link only writes .lerd.yaml when it already exists** — avoids creating an unnecessary config file for projects that don't use one.

### Changed

- **Site enrichment consolidated into `internal/siteinfo`** — CLI, MCP, and UI no longer duplicate site enrichment logic. A single `LoadAll(flags)` function with flag-based enrichment replaces ~340 lines of duplicated code across three packages.
- **Link/unlink core logic extracted into `internal/siteops`** — shared site operations (vhost generation, site naming, linking, unlinking) moved out of the CLI package for reuse by MCP and UI.
- **Framework detection centralised** — `DetectFrameworkForDir` and `.lerd.yaml` operations moved into the config package, eliminating scattered detection logic.

---

## [1.10.1] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **phpMyAdmin (and other `dynamic_env` presets) connected to wrong host** — the Web UI and MCP `service_start`/`service_add` code paths generated custom service quadlets without resolving `dynamic_env` directives, so `PMA_HOSTS` was never set and phpMyAdmin fell back to its default host `db`. All three paths now delegate to `serviceops.EnsureCustomServiceQuadlet` which handles `dynamic_env` resolution and file materialisation.

---

## [1.10.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Framework definition store** — community framework store backed by `geodro/lerd-frameworks` with `lerd framework search`, `lerd framework install`, and `lerd framework update` commands. Definitions auto-fetch when linking a project and auto-refresh after 24 hours. MCP tools `framework_search` and `framework_install` expose the store to AI assistants. (#103)
- **Framework-agnostic worker system** — all hardcoded Laravel worker logic replaced with a generic system driven by framework YAML definitions. Dedicated commands (`queue`, `schedule`, `reverb`, `horizon`) are now aliases that read from the framework definition. Workers support `conflicts_with`, proxy config with auto port assignment, and port collision prevention across sites.
- **Worker add/remove CLI and MCP tools** — `lerd worker add` and `lerd worker remove` manage custom workers in `.lerd.yaml` (project-level) or the global framework overlay (`--global`). Orphaned workers (running units with no framework definition) are detected and surfaced in `worker list`, `worker stop`, and setup.
- **PHP version ranges** — framework definitions declare supported PHP min/max ranges. `lerd link` and `lerd init` clamp the PHP version to the framework's supported range. `lerd sites` and the UI show the framework version (e.g. "Laravel 11").
- **`{{domain}}` and `{{scheme}}` template vars** — framework env var templates can reference the site's primary domain and TLS scheme. `.env` keys like `APP_URL`, `VITE_REVERB_HOST`, and `VITE_REVERB_SCHEME` sync automatically when the primary domain changes.
- **Selenium service preset** — bundled `selenium` preset (selenium/standalone-chromium) for browser testing with Laravel Dusk. Auto-detected via `composer_detect` on `laravel/dusk`, patches `DuskTestCase.php`, and includes noVNC on port 7900 for watching tests live. New `share_hosts` field on custom services maps `.test` domains to the nginx container IP.
- **Cursor MCP support** — `mcp:inject` and `mcp:enable-global` now write Cursor configuration (`.cursor/mcp.json` and `.cursor/rules/lerd.mdc`). (#132)
- **Ghostscript in PHP-FPM** — `ghostscript` added to the base PHP-FPM image for PDF manipulation with libraries like Spatie MediaLibrary. (#138)
- **mysql-client in PHP-FPM** — `mysql-client` added to the PHP-FPM image so `mysqldump` works inside `lerd php` sessions. (#142)

### Changed

- **MCP tool responses optimised for AI agents** — ANSI escape codes stripped from all CLI output. `doctor`, `check`, and `env_check` return structured JSON instead of raw text. `env:check` no longer exits non-zero.
- **CI auto-rebuilds PHP images** — a scheduled workflow checks Docker Hub daily for upstream `php:X.Y-fpm-alpine` security patches and triggers a force rebuild when new digests appear.

### Fixed

- **`php:rebuild` reused stale base images** — `lerd php rebuild` now always pulls fresh base images instead of building on top of potentially outdated cached layers. (#140)
- **`npm run build` failed when `node_modules` missing** — build step is now guarded so it skips gracefully when dependencies haven't been installed. (#133)

---

## [1.9.4] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Extra volume mounts lost after install/update** — `lerd install` rewrote nginx and service quadlets from raw templates, dropping extra volume mounts for projects outside `$HOME`. Mounts now survive install and update cycles.

---

## [1.9.3] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Projects outside `$HOME` failed with "chdir: No such file or directory"** — the PHP-FPM and nginx containers only bind-mount `$HOME`, so projects in `/var/www`, `/opt/projects`, or similar paths could not be served or exec'd into. Lerd now automatically injects extra volume mounts into both containers when it detects a project outside the home directory. Mounts are added transparently during `lerd link`, `lerd park`, or any exec command (`lerd php`, `composer`, `laravel new`) and cleaned up on `lerd unlink` / `lerd unpark`. (#120)
- **Env file keys appended instead of uncommented** — when a `.env` key existed but was commented out (`#DB_HOST=...`), `lerd env` appended a duplicate instead of uncommenting the existing line in place.

### Added

- **`lerd doctor` checks for crun** — warns when `crun` is not installed, since it is the recommended OCI runtime for rootless Podman.

---

## [1.9.2] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Site service badges missed .env-detected services** — badges on the site detail panel only showed services declared in `.lerd.yaml`. Now also scans the site's `.env` for `lerd-{name}` references (both built-in and custom services), matching the same auto-detection logic the Services tab already uses.

---

## [1.9.1] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **Queue workers silently lost on uninstall+reinstall** — `queueStartExplicit` ran a Redis preflight that returned an error before the unit file was written. Install-time `restoreSiteInfrastructure` runs *before* any services are started, so for sites with `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` the write step always failed and the worker units stayed missing on disk while systemd remembered them as `not-found failed`. The preflight is gone; the dependency now lives in the systemd unit itself. `lerd-queue-<site>.service` declares `After=`/`Wants=` for whatever the queue backend needs (`lerd-redis.service` when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`, `lerd-mysql.service` / `lerd-postgres.service` for database-backed queues) on top of the FPM container, and `lerd-horizon-<site>.service` always declares `lerd-redis.service`. systemd handles the activation order and `Restart=always` covers the small ready-window between activation and the backing container accepting connections.
- **Preset-installed services not regenerated on reinstall** — `restoreSiteInfrastructure` only handled inline custom services and built-in named refs. Preset references like `mariadb-11` (declared in `.lerd.yaml` as `mariadb-11: {preset: mariadb, version: "11"}`) fell through to `ensureServiceQuadlet`, which only knows about built-ins, so the silently-swallowed `unknown service` error left sites with no quadlet for any preset-installed service after an uninstall+reinstall cycle. The restore path now goes through `ProjectService.Resolve()` which already knows how to render both inline and preset references back into a concrete `CustomService`.

### Changed

- **`lerd status` shows `[preset]` for preset-installed services** instead of grouping them under `[custom]`. Hand-rolled custom services keep the `[custom]` label.
- **Tagline reworded** — `lerd --help`, the `install.sh` banner, and the goreleaser GitHub release notes header now read `Lerd — Podman-powered local PHP dev environment for Linux` instead of `Laravel Herd for Linux — …`.
- **Services walkthrough** (`docs/getting-started/services.md`) updated to lead with the bundled preset flow for MongoDB, phpMyAdmin, and pgAdmin (`lerd service preset <name>`) instead of the hand-rolled YAML each one used to require. Adminer, Elasticsearch, and RabbitMQ stay as full YAML recipes since there's no preset for them yet. Adminer's port bumped to 8083 to avoid colliding with the `mongo-express` preset on 8082.

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Service presets** — opt-in bundled service definitions surfaced via `lerd service preset` (list / install) and a `+` picker on the Web UI's Services tab. First batch ships `phpmyadmin`, `pgadmin`, `mongo`, `mongo-express`, and `stripe-mock` as embedded YAML that becomes a normal custom service once installed, so every existing `lerd service` subcommand (start/stop/remove/expose/pin) keeps working unchanged. Installed presets are filtered out of the picker; after install the user lands on the new service detail panel and the service auto-starts.
- **Multi-version preset families** — presets can declare multiple versions in a single YAML (e.g. `mysql` 8.0/8.4/9.0, `mariadb` 10.11/11.4) and `lerd service preset` shows version pills on `list`, prompts for a version on install, and persists the chosen tag in `.lerd.yaml`. Family discovery groups versions by base name in both the CLI list and the Web UI picker.
- **Preset MCP tools** — `service_preset_list` and `service_preset_install` expose the preset catalog and install flow to AI assistants, sharing the install path with the CLI through `serviceops.InstallPresetByName`. Re-run `lerd mcp:inject` in existing projects to pick up the new tool descriptions.
- **Custom service `files:` field** — declare inline-rendered config files materialised on the host and bind-mounted into the container, with optional `mode` (octal perms) and `chown: true` (adds `:U` so podman re-chowns to the container's non-root uid). Used by the `pgadmin` preset to ship a `servers.json` + `pgpass` that autoconnects to `lerd-postgres`. Files re-render on every `lerd service start` so editing the YAML and restarting picks up changes.
- **Custom service `connection_url:` field** — non-built-in databases now get the same "Open connection URL" link surface as the built-in mysql/postgres services. The detail panel renders a real `<a>` element pointing at `mysql://`, `postgresql://`, or `mongodb://` so right-click "Copy link" works and left-click hands the URL to the user's registered DB client (DBeaver, TablePlus, Compass, etc.).
- **Recursive `service start`** — `lerd service start <svc>` now ensures every entry in `depends_on` is up first, recursively, in both the CLI and the Web UI. Pairs with the existing recursive stop that takes dependents down before the parent. Starting any preset that depends on a built-in (`phpmyadmin`, `pgadmin`) auto-starts the database.
- **Preset dependency gating at install time** — installing a preset whose dependency is another *custom* service (e.g. `mongo-express` on `mongo`) is rejected with a clear error until the dependency is installed first. Built-in deps (mysql, postgres) are auto-satisfied. The Web UI's Add button is disabled with a matching amber "install mongo first" hint.
- **Database service quality-of-life suggestions** — the detail panel of every database service (mysql, postgres, and an installed `mongo`) now shows a sky-blue suggestion banner offering to install its paired admin UI when missing. The banner is dismissable per-preset and the dismissal persists in `localStorage`. When the admin UI is installed, the header gains an Open phpMyAdmin / pgAdmin / Mongo Express button that auto-starts the admin service if needed.
- **Lerd health dot in the Web UI** — the Lerd entry in the System list now reflects overall core health (green when DNS / nginx / watcher are all running, red when any is down, yellow when an update is available) instead of only the update flag. The lerd logo in the left rail gains a small yellow badge when an update is available and is clickable, jumping straight to the Lerd entry.
- **One-click update terminal** — when an update is available, the Lerd entry exposes an "Open terminal & update" button that POSTs to the new loopback-only `/api/lerd/update-terminal` endpoint, which spawns the user's preferred terminal emulator (kitty / foot / alacritty / wezterm / ghostty / ptyxis / konsole / gnome-terminal / xfce4-terminal / tilix / terminator / xterm) running `lerd update` so the host can prompt for sudo and stream download progress.
- **Getting-started walkthroughs** — new `docs/getting-started/laravel.md`, `symfony.md`, `wordpress.md`, and `services.md` pages plus a `docs/usage/lifecycle.md` reference covering how Lerd's units come up at boot and how `start` / `stop` / `autostart` interact.

### Changed

- **`autostart` is now a single coherent switch** — `cfg.Autostart.Disabled` is the canonical source of truth for whether lerd comes up at login. Toggling it enables/disables every `lerd-*.container` quadlet (by adding/stripping the `[Install]` section so the podman generator stops emitting the `default.target.wants` symlink) and every `lerd-*.service` unit (UI, watcher, per-site worker/queue/schedule/horizon/reverb/stripe) together. Toggling does not stop or start anything currently running — the user is in the middle of working and a session-level switch should not yank infrastructure out from under them. Use `lerd start` / `lerd stop` for live state.
- **`lerd autostart tray` removed** — the tray is now governed by the same single autostart switch as everything else. The standalone `autostart tray` subcommand and the `lerd-autostart.service` unit file are gone.
- **Service display labels** — the Web UI now shows phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Meilisearch, Mailpit, RustFS, MongoDB, Mongo Express, and Stripe Mock with their proper casing.

### Fixed

- **Tray autostart was broken** — the tray autostart path went through the now-removed `lerd-autostart.service` shim and stopped enabling on fresh installs. The unified autostart toggle now covers the tray too, the per-unit autostart toggle is wired up correctly, and `lerd install` honours the persisted autostart state.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **`lerd lan:expose` / `lan:unexpose` / `lan:status`** — unified switch to share a lerd dev environment with another machine on the local network. Off by default; every container port now binds `127.0.0.1` (was `0.0.0.0` since v0.1.0), so untrusted wifi is safe out of the box. Service containers (mysql, postgres, redis, meilisearch, rustfs, mailpit) stay loopback-only even when LAN exposure is on; only nginx flips to `0.0.0.0`, since Laravel apps in `lerd-php-fpm` reach services through the podman bridge regardless of host bind. Quadlets are rewritten centrally via `podman.WriteQuadletDiff` so flipping the switch only restarts units whose on-disk content actually changed.
- **Remote dashboard access** — the dashboard at port 7073 is gated by two independent flags: `cfg.LAN.Exposed` is the top-level kill switch and `cfg.UI.PasswordHash` adds HTTP Basic auth on top. LAN clients only reach the dashboard when both are set; loopback always bypasses both. Stale credentials cannot survive `lan:unexpose`. The dashboard's "Remote dashboard access" card distinguishes active / inert / disabled states so the user sees when credentials are stored but blocked by `lan:unexpose`. UI feedback during a toggle streams NDJSON progress events from `POST /api/lan/status`; the card polls every 5s while on the System tab so CLI toggles are reflected without a page reload.
- **`http://lerd.localhost` as a usable bookmark** — `lerd-nginx` serves the static dashboard HTML, icons, and PWA manifest from the `lerd.localhost` vhost, with `/api/*` explicitly returning 444 so a LAN curl forging the Host header cannot reach `lerd-ui` through the proxy. The dashboard JS detects when it was loaded from `lerd.localhost` and rewrites all fetch, EventSource, and favicon img srcs to absolute `http://localhost:7073` URLs so they hit `lerd-ui` directly over loopback.
- **`lerd remote-setup`** — generates a one-shot 15-minute code and prints a curl one-liner the remote machine runs to install mkcert, trust the lerd root CA, and configure its resolver (NetworkManager+dnsmasq, systemd-resolved 254+, standalone dnsmasq, or macOS `/etc/resolver`). The endpoint is gated by token presence + RFC 1918 source IP + brute-force lockout. The bootstrap script's epilogue warns that the server IP is hardcoded into the resolver dropin and explains how to re-bootstrap if the server moves networks.
- **`app_url` field in `.lerd.yaml` and `sites.yaml`** — new precedence chain for `APP_URL`: `.lerd.yaml` `app_url` (committed, shared across machines) > `sites.yaml` `app_url` (per-machine override) > the default `<scheme>://<primary-domain>` generator. `lerd setup` no longer overwrites a custom `APP_URL` on every run — set it once in `.lerd.yaml` and lerd respects it. The `.lerd.yaml` `app_url` is silently suppressed when its host points at a domain that the conflict filter dropped, so `.env` never ends up writing a hostname owned by another site.
- **Soft-fallback domain conflict handling** — when `lerd link` or the parked-directory watcher tries to register a domain another site already owns, the conflicting domain is now filtered out (instead of failing the whole link) and a clear WARN line is printed naming the owning site. Surviving domains still register; if every domain conflicts, lerd falls back to a freshly generated `<dirname>.<tld>` with a numeric suffix. `.lerd.yaml` is never modified on disk — the original `domains:` list stays so the conflict is visible to the UI and self-heals on the next link if the owning site is removed.
- **Domain conflict UI surface** — the site detail header's "+N more" pill now counts conflicted domains and shows an amber warning icon when present (hover reveals each conflicted entry with the owning site name). The Manage Domains modal renders conflicted entries at the top with a warning icon, the domain struck-through, a "used by &lt;site&gt;" pill, and a small trash button that removes the entry from `.lerd.yaml` only (no registry, vhost, or cert touched). The `domain:remove` server action detects conflict-filtered entries and routes them to a `.lerd.yaml`-only delete path.
- **`[Remote Access]` section in `lerd status`** — new block showing LAN exposure state and dashboard remote-access state, with hints when off. Refactored into a testable `printRemoteAccessStatus` helper.
- **Tray "Expose to LAN" toggle** — new menu item that shells out to `lerd lan expose / unexpose`, mirroring the autostart toggle.
- **Dynamic colour tray icon** — white L when lerd is running, red L when stopped. The default flag flipped from `--mono=true` to `--mono=false` so the colour icon is what users see by default; mono mode is still available for OS-recoloured template icons. The icon's dark background was stripped so it's transparent on the panel.

### Changed

- **Tray "Open Dashboard" opens `http://lerd.localhost`** instead of the bare `127.0.0.1:7073` loopback URL. Tray API polling stays on loopback so the tray works before nginx is up.
- **Tray paused services render with a yellow dot** instead of red, so user-initiated stops are visually distinct from broken services.
- **`lerd doctor` "linger enabled" check renamed** to "systemd linger" so the WARN row no longer reads as if linger is in fact enabled.

### Fixed

- **`lerd uninstall` left the tray running** — the uninstall flow stopped and disabled all systemd units but never killed standalone tray processes (launched from the desktop file or `lerd tray`). The tray kept running after the binary was gone, with no way to dismiss it short of `pkill`. Uninstall now calls the existing `killTray` helper after the unit teardown.
- **`lerd install` hang when installing the Laravel installer** — the installer prompted for the Laravel installer on every run and then shelled out through the composer shim, which routes through `lerd php` and depends on cwd-based PHP detection. When the install command runs from `$HOME` with no project metadata, detection fell back to `cfg.PHP.DefaultVersion` and handed composer to a possibly-missing container. Worse, `composer global require` triggers symfony/flex / plugin trust prompts which sat invisibly inside `podman exec -t -i`, making the whole step look stuck with no output. Fixed by skipping the prompt entirely when no PHP version is installed, and when it does run, bypassing the shim — picking a known-installed PHP (preferring the configured default), ensuring its FPM container is running, and `podman exec`'ing `composer global require --no-interaction laravel/installer` directly.

---

## [1.7.1] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Database picker in `lerd init`** — the wizard's services step is now split into a single-choice **Database** select (sqlite / mysql / postgres) and a multi-select for everything else. The default is seeded from any database already in `.lerd.yaml`, then `DB_CONNECTION` in `.env` (or `.env.example` for fresh clones), falling back to SQLite. After the wizard completes, `lerd env` runs automatically so the choice immediately lands in `.env` — picking MySQL/PostgreSQL writes the connection vars and creates the project database (plus `_testing`), picking SQLite writes `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and creates `database/database.sqlite` if it's missing.
- **Runtime database prompt in `lerd env`** — when run interactively on a Laravel project whose `.env` says `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and whose `.lerd.yaml` doesn't yet pick a database, `lerd env` now prompts for a deliberate choice (Keep SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL) and persists it so subsequent runs don't re-ask. Skipped automatically when stdin isn't a TTY (CI, MCP, scripted runs) and for frameworks with explicit env service rules (Symfony, WordPress, etc.) that don't use `DB_CONNECTION`.
- **`db_set` MCP tool** — pick the database for a Laravel project from an AI assistant: `db_set(database: "sqlite" | "mysql" | "postgres")`. Persists the choice to `.lerd.yaml` (replacing any prior database — the choice is exclusive), rewrites the `DB_` keys in `.env`, starts the service if needed, and creates the database (or the SQLite file). The companion `env_setup` tool's description now points at `db_set` so AI assistants know to call it before `env_setup` on fresh Laravel clones — `env_setup` alone leaves `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` untouched.
- **SQLite as a first-class env-time choice** — `serviceEnvVars["sqlite"]` now applies `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and `DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite`. The `lerd env` flow special-cases sqlite so it isn't treated as a podman service: no quadlet, no `service_start`, just the env vars and the file creation. The user's database choice in `.lerd.yaml` is authoritative — switching from mysql → sqlite (or vice versa) skips the auto-detection of the previous database in `.env`.

### Fixed

- **`vendor_bins` / `vendor_run` missing from injected MCP skills** — the new vendor/bin tooling shipped in v1.7.0 was registered with the MCP server but absent from the skill content that `lerd mcp:inject` writes into `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md` and `.junie/guidelines.md`, so AI assistants weren't told the tools existed. Both files now describe the tools with examples for pest, phpunit, pint, phpstan, and rector. Re-run `lerd mcp:inject` in existing projects to pick up the updated skill content.

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Application log viewer in the UI** — site detail view now has an App Logs tab that parses application log files into a structured table with level, date, and message columns, expandable to show full stacktraces. Frameworks declare log file locations and parser format via a new `logs` field in their YAML; Laravel defaults to `storage/logs/*.log` with Monolog parsing. Auto-selects the site with the most recent log activity on page load, refreshes every 5 seconds, and supports search filtering plus a Latest/All toggle. Entries display oldest-first (newest at the bottom), pinned to the bottom on every refresh, matching the streaming container/queue/worker log panes.
- **`vendor/bin` shortcuts and `lerd test` / `lerd a` aliases** — any composer-installed binary in the project's `vendor/bin` is now callable directly as `lerd <name>` (e.g. `lerd pest`, `lerd pint`, `lerd phpstan`), routed through the project's PHP-FPM container with `vendor/bin` prepended to `PATH`. Built-in lerd commands always win on name collisions. Two new shortcuts: `lerd a` (alias for `artisan`) and `lerd test` (shortcut for `artisan test`). The same surface is exposed to MCP clients via `vendor_bins` (list) and `vendor_run` (execute). Closes #101.
- **Laravel installer shipped globally** — `lerd install` now offers to install `laravel/installer` as a global composer package and creates a `laravel` shim in `BinDir` routed through `lerd php`, so the `laravel` command works directly in the terminal the way Herd ships it. The prompt defaults to yes and runs before the parallel TUI to avoid stdin conflicts. Closes #98.
- **Site favicons in the UI** — the UI detects `favicon.ico`/`svg`/`png` in each site's public directory and serves them via `GET /api/sites/{domain}/favicon`. The sites list and detail header now display the favicon when available, falling back to the status dot.

### Changed

- **PHP and Node version selects deferred until loaded** — the version dropdowns in the site detail view now show static placeholders while the version lists are still loading, preventing the browser from resetting `selectedSite.php_version` / `node_version` to an empty string and causing spurious change events.

### Fixed

- **Dark mode dropdown readability** — the PHP and Node version selectors now apply explicit option background and text colors so the dropdown menu is readable in dark mode.

---

## [1.6.3] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

- **Tray switched to libayatana-appindicator** — the system tray now uses the actively maintained ayatana fork instead of the legacy libappindicator3. No behavior change; ayatana is the default backend in getlantern/systray and is already present on Ubuntu desktops.
- **`lerd update` defaults to yes** — pressing Enter now confirms the update instead of cancelling.

### Fixed

- **DNS broken on systems without NetworkManager** — the resolved drop-in file was written with 0600 permissions (unreadable by systemd-resolved), breaking `.test` domain resolution on omarchy and similar systems. Fixed by setting correct permissions (0644) via `sudoWriteFile`.
- **Sudoers missing resolved paths** — extended the sudoers drop-in to cover systemd-resolved config paths for passwordless install/start on resolved-only systems.

---

## [1.6.2] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **MissingAppKeyException on fresh project** — `lerd env` now generates `APP_KEY` directly in `.env` when `vendor/` does not exist yet, instead of failing silently on `artisan key:generate`. This prevents Laravel's `MissingAppKeyException` during `composer install` post-install scripts in the `lerd new` → `lerd link` → `lerd setup` flow.
- **`composer install` using wrong PHP version in setup** — `lerd setup` now runs `composer install` inside the project's PHP-FPM container, matching the `composer.json` PHP constraint. Previously it used the host composer shim which could resolve to the global default PHP version.
- **PHP version detection from `composer.json` ignores installed versions** — the constraint resolver now picks the highest installed PHP version satisfying the `composer.json` `require.php` constraint (e.g. `^8.3` with 8.3 and 8.4 installed → 8.4). Supports `^`, `~`, `>=`, `<`, `||`, `*`, and AND constraints. Falls back to the literal minimum when no installed version matches.

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Fresh install missing default PHP-FPM** — `lerd install` now always builds and starts the default PHP version, even with no registered sites. Previously `lerd new` would fail on a fresh install because no PHP-FPM container existed.
- **Install not restoring services** — `lerd install` now restores service quadlets (mysql, redis, custom services) from `.lerd.yaml`, pulls missing images, and starts them. Workers no longer fail on reinstall because their dependencies are running.
- **Install not restoring workers** — `lerd install` now calls `restoreSiteInfrastructure` to recreate worker units from `.lerd.yaml` after services are started.
- **FPM not restored for sites using default PHP** — both `lerd install` and `lerd start` now fall back to the configured default PHP version when a site has no explicit `PHPVersion`, instead of skipping it.
- **UI stripe toggle not syncing `.lerd.yaml`** — toggling the Stripe listener from the web UI now writes the workers list to `.lerd.yaml`, matching the behaviour of all other worker toggles.
- **Uninstall spinner with no expandable output** — replaced the StepRunner spinner (Ctrl+O did nothing) with the same `step()`/`ok()` output style used by install.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Framework setup commands** — framework definitions now support a `setup` field with one-off bootstrap commands (migrations, storage links, fixtures) shown in `lerd setup`. Laravel's hardcoded storage:link/migrate/db:seed steps are now part of the built-in framework definition. Custom frameworks define their own via YAML.
- **Conditional checks on workers and setup commands** — both `workers` and `setup` entries support an optional `check` field (`file` or `composer`) to conditionally show them based on project dependencies (e.g. messenger worker only shown when `symfony/messenger` is installed).
- **Service version placeholders** — framework env vars support `{{mysql_version}}`, `{{postgres_version}}`, `{{redis_version}}`, and `{{meilisearch_version}}` placeholders, resolved from the running service image tag at `lerd env` time.
- **`--setup` flag for `lerd framework add`** — define setup commands via CLI flags in addition to YAML.
- **Link modal streaming logs** — the web UI link modal now streams `lerd link` and `lerd env` output line-by-line instead of showing only a spinner.
- **Domain modal success feedback** — add/edit/remove domain operations in the web UI now show a flash message on success.
- **omarchy OS support** — systems with systemd-resolved but no NetworkManager can now install and run lerd. The installer accepts either resolver.
- **Reverb prerequisite check** — `lerd reverb:start` and `lerd reverb:stop` now check for `laravel/reverb` in composer.json before proceeding, with install instructions and a link to the Laravel Broadcasting docs.

### Changed

- **Worker state synced to `.lerd.yaml`** — all worker start/stop commands (`queue`, `schedule`, `reverb`, `horizon`, `stripe:listen`, `worker start/stop`) now persist the active workers list in `.lerd.yaml` when the file exists. Previously `worker start/stop` and `stripe:listen` did not update the file.
- **`lerd start` restores site infrastructure** — after an uninstall/reinstall cycle, `lerd start` reads `.lerd.yaml` from each active site and recreates missing FPM quadlets, service quadlets, and worker units automatically.
- **`lerd install` restores FPM quadlets** — reinstalling now restores PHP-FPM quadlets for all PHP versions used by registered sites, not just the default version.
- **Improved `lerd uninstall`** — stops all `lerd-*` systemd units (workers, stripe listeners, etc.) instead of only the hardcoded watcher and UI services. DNS teardown and the data-removal prompt now run before the step runner to avoid stdin conflicts.

### Fixed

- **DNS teardown leaves stale DNS on virtual interfaces** — `lerd uninstall` now reverts all network interfaces that have lerd DNS configured (e.g. `virbr0`, `vnet*`), not just the default interface.
- **Internet DNS broken after uninstall** — after reverting interfaces and restarting NetworkManager, lerd now explicitly pushes the DHCP-assigned upstream DNS servers so name resolution works immediately.
- **Domain modal stale state** — the web UI domain modal now properly updates the domain list after add/edit/remove operations. The site list merge was matching by domain (which changes) instead of name (stable).
- **`lerd env` runs automatically in setup** — `lerd env` now runs at the start of `lerd setup` instead of being a selectable step, ensuring `.env` is configured before `composer install` triggers post-install scripts.
- **Definition conflict resolution** — when `.lerd.yaml` and the local framework/service definition differ, lerd now offers a three-way choice: use .lerd.yaml version, use local definition, or skip. Both sync directions persist immediately.
- **Improved horizon/reverb error messages** — error messages now include install commands and docs links instead of generic text.
- **Dynamic DNS resolver hints** — `lerd doctor` and `lerd status` now show the correct restart command based on the active resolver instead of always suggesting "restart NetworkManager".

### Docs

- Added contributing section to nav bar, stripe page to usage sidebar, troubleshooting to reference sidebar
- Fixed `{{site}}` placeholders being swallowed by VitePress (Vue template interpolation)
- Replaced non-rendering mermaid chart with ASCII diagram on architecture page
- Added reverb prerequisite note to commands reference
- Updated requirements, architecture, and troubleshooting for systemd-resolved support

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Nginx fails to start when TLS certificates are missing** — `lerd start` now detects SSL vhosts referencing missing cert files before starting nginx, switches affected sites back to HTTP, and removes orphan SSL configs. Previously a single missing certificate would prevent all sites from loading.
- **Paused sites bypass landing page after update** — `lerd install` (called by `lerd update`) was regenerating vhosts for all sites, overwriting paused landing pages with the full site config. Paused and ignored sites are now skipped during vhost regeneration.
- **Paused landing page redesigned** — the paused page now matches the branded "Site Not Found" page with the Lerd logo, red accent, and Resume + Dashboard buttons. Uses a single shared HTML file instead of generating one per site.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Multi-domain support** — sites can now respond to multiple `.test` domains. Use `lerd domain add`, `lerd domain remove`, and `lerd domain list` to manage them. Domains are stored in `.lerd.yaml` and the certificate is reissued automatically when a domain is added to a secured site.
- **`lerd env:check` command** — compare all `.env` files against `.env.example` and flag missing or extra keys. Exits non-zero when required keys are missing.
- **`lerd check` command** — validate `.lerd.yaml` syntax, PHP version, Node version, services, frameworks, and workers before running setup. Reports OK/WARN/FAIL per field.
- **`lerd which` command** — show the resolved PHP version, Node version, document root, and nginx config paths for the current site.
- **Port conflict detection** — `lerd start` checks for port conflicts before starting containers and warns if another process is already using a required port.
- **`lerd update --beta`** — update to the latest pre-release build from GitHub.
- **`lerd update --rollback`** — revert to the previously installed version using the automatic backup.
- **Automatic PHP/Node version switching** — the watcher monitors `.lerd.yaml`, `.php-version`, `.node-version`, and `.nvmrc` and automatically re-links the site when versions change.
- **Workers in `lerd init`** — the wizard includes a workers step that pre-selects workers based on the framework and installed packages. Horizon is auto-detected from `composer.json`.
- **Setup prompt on link** — when linking a site with workers configured in `.lerd.yaml`, lerd prompts to run `lerd setup` to install dependencies and start workers.
- **Branded error pages** — requests to unlinked `.test` domains show a styled "Site Not Found" page with links to the dashboard instead of a generic browser error.
- **Failing worker visibility** — `lerd status` shows failing and restarting workers across all sites. The web UI shows a pulsing red toggle and a "!" indicator on the log tab for failing workers.

### Fixed

- **Crash-looping workers left running after unlink** — `lerd unlink` now detects and stops crash-looping workers for the site.
- **Paused sites counted in status workers section** — paused sites are now excluded from the workers list in `lerd status`.
- **Paused sites counted in TLS check** — `lerd status` no longer flags TLS issues for paused or ignored sites.
- **Service container left behind on remove** — `lerd service remove` now properly cleans up the Podman container.

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **Paused sites counted in service badges and auto-stop logic** — paused sites were included when counting how many sites use a service, so services stayed active and their site-count badges inflated even after all active sites were paused. Paused sites are now excluded from `CountSitesUsingService` and the badge tooltip list.

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **3-pane dashboard layout missing from v1.4.0** — the new icon rail, list panel, and full-height detail panel were lost during a merge conflict resolution. The correct UI is now restored.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added

- **3-pane dashboard layout** — the UI is redesigned around a persistent icon rail (Sites, Services, System), a scrollable list panel, and a full-height detail panel. Logs fill remaining height rather than being capped at a fixed box. Works at any scale from 1 to 50+ sites. Mobile gets a full-screen list/detail with a bottom tab bar and a back button.
- **PHP-FPM auto-lifecycle** — FPM containers for unused PHP versions are stopped automatically on `lerd unlink` and `lerd start`. Paused sites keep their FPM running. On `lerd start`, only versions referenced by at least one site are started. When a site is unpaused, its FPM container is guaranteed running before nginx is restored.
- **Manual FPM start/stop from the dashboard** — unused PHP versions (no active sites) show a Stop button in the dashboard when running. Stopped unused versions are shown with a neutral badge rather than an error.
- **`lerd start` parallel spinner UI** — start and stop operations now show a live per-unit progress display. All images required by units are checked and rebuilt or pulled before containers start.
- **Site pills on services** — core services (MySQL, Mailpit, etc.) and worker-type services (Queue, Horizon, Reverb, etc.) show clickable site pills. Clicking a pill navigates directly to that site's settings.
- **Clickable PHP-FPM site pills** — site pills on the PHP-FPM detail panel now navigate to the site's settings panel instead of opening the browser.
- **Instant system theme switching** — when the theme is set to Auto, the dashboard switches between light and dark immediately as the OS preference changes, without a page reload.

### Fixed

- **`lerd status` false errors for stopped unused PHP-FPM** — stopped FPM containers for versions not referenced by any site are now reported as warnings, not errors.
- **MinIO migration prompt shown after already migrating to RustFS** — the `lerd update` migration prompt now also checks whether the `lerd-minio` container is running, so users who have already migrated are not prompted again.
- **Pre-built PHP base images required ghcr.io login** — lerd now always pulls base images anonymously to avoid authentication errors from expired or unrelated ghcr.io credentials.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **Broadcasting jobs fail when `lerd env` was run on a Reverb site** — `REVERB_HOST` was set to the site domain (e.g. `my-app.test`), which resolves inside the PHP-FPM container to `host.containers.internal` (169.254.1.2). That address — the nginx proxy on the host — is not reachable from inside the container's network namespace, so every broadcast job failed with cURL error 7. `REVERB_HOST`, `REVERB_PORT`, and `REVERB_SCHEME` are now always written as `localhost`, `REVERB_SERVER_PORT`, and `http` so the queue worker connects to Reverb directly inside the same container. `VITE_REVERB_HOST/PORT/SCHEME` continue to use the site domain and external port for browser connections through nginx. Sites affected can be fixed by re-running `lerd env`.
- **Log lines repeating on SSE reconnect** — when the browser reconnected to a log stream (network blip, tab restore) the entire history was replayed from the start. For systemd units the stream now emits the journalctl cursor as the SSE event id and resumes with `--after-cursor` on reconnect; for Podman containers a monotonic line counter is used and `--tail 0` skips history on reconnect.

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **Queue log streaming was a stale duplicate of the shared implementation** — the `/api/queue/<site>/logs` SSE handler had its own inline copy of the log streaming logic instead of calling the shared `streamUnitLogs` helper used by every other worker (horizon, schedule, reverb, stripe). The duplicate is removed.

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **PHP FPM fails to start on fresh installs** — the shared hosts file (`~/.local/share/lerd/hosts`) is bind-mounted into every PHP-FPM container. If no site had ever been linked, the file did not exist and podman refused to start the container with `statfs: no such file or directory`. `WriteFPMQuadlet` now ensures the file is created before the container is started.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Multiple Reverb sites without port collisions** — when `lerd env` detects `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb`, it auto-assigns a unique `REVERB_SERVER_PORT` per site starting at 8080 and incrementing for each additional site. `reverb:start` (including the UI toggle) also assigns and persists the port on first start if still missing, so the fix applies even when `lerd env` has not been re-run. The nginx WebSocket proxy uses the per-site port instead of the old hardcoded 8080. Fixes [#47](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/issues/47).
- **New MCP tools: `db_import`, `db_create`, `php_list`, `php_ext`, `park`, `unpark`** — six new tools for AI agents covering database import from a SQL file, on-demand database creation, listing installed PHP versions, managing PHP extensions, and parking/unparking directories.
- **`lerd whatsnew`** — new command that prints the changelog for the currently installed version. The changelog excerpt has been removed from `lerd status` and `lerd doctor` output.
- **Portable `.lerd.yaml`** — `.lerd.yaml` can now describe a site's full local environment (PHP version, Node version, framework, services, custom workers). Running `lerd link` in a project that has a `.lerd.yaml` applies all settings automatically, so cloning a project and running `lerd link && lerd env` is enough to reproduce the full environment. Closes [#33](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/issues/33).
- **Pre-built PHP base images** — PHP images are now built on top of pre-built base images pulled from `ghcr.io` instead of compiling all extensions from source. First-install time drops from ~5 minutes to ~30 seconds. Closes [#43](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/issues/43).

---

## [1.2.4] — 2026-03-31

### Added

- **`lerd php:rebuild` accepts a version argument** — pass a version (e.g. `lerd php:rebuild 8.3`) to rebuild only that PHP image instead of all installed versions.

### Fixed

- **Inter-application `.test` domain resolution inside containers** — HTTP/HTTPS requests from one site to another (e.g. `booking.test` calling `staffing.test`) were failing because `.test` domains resolved to `127.0.0.1` inside containers, which points to the container itself rather than the host Nginx. A shared hosts file (`~/.local/share/lerd/hosts`) is now bind-mounted into every PHP-FPM container at `/etc/hosts` with a `169.254.1.2` entry per linked site. Since it is a bind mount, `lerd link` and `lerd unlink` update all running containers instantly without a restart. Fixes [#39](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/issues/39).
- **Reverb proxy returns 502 after container restart** — the Nginx `location /app` block used a bare hostname in `proxy_pass`, which Nginx resolves once at config load time. If the PHP-FPM container restarted and received a new IP, subsequent WebSocket and broadcast requests failed with 502. The proxy now uses a variable (`set $reverb`) to force per-request DNS resolution, matching how the FastCGI location already handles the FPM upstream.

---

## [1.2.3] — 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Horizon appears in the Services panel** — when Laravel Horizon is running for a site it now shows up as its own entry in the Services panel (grouped under "Horizon"), with a stop button, live log stream, and a subtitle showing the site domain. Previously Horizon was only visible in the site detail view.
- **Starting Horizon stops the queue worker** — `horizon:start` (CLI, UI, MCP) now automatically stops any running queue worker for the same site before starting Horizon, since the two must not run simultaneously.
- **`lerd unlink` stops all workers for the site** — queue workers, Horizon, schedule workers, Reverb, Stripe listeners, and custom framework workers are all stopped before the site is unlinked.

### Fixed

- **Tray no longer shows per-site workers** — Reverb, Horizon, queue workers, schedule workers, Stripe listeners, and custom framework workers are filtered out of the tray menu. Only real infrastructure services (MySQL, Redis, Mailpit, etc.) are listed there.
- **`lerd php` can now run scripts outside `$HOME`** — IDEs like PhpStorm write their validation scripts to `/tmp` and call `php -d... /tmp/ide-phpinfo.php`. The container only mounts `$HOME`, so those scripts were unreachable and produced an empty output ("Failed to parse validation script output"). `runPhp` now detects any argument that is an absolute path to a host file outside `$HOME`, reads it, and streams it to the container via `stdin` / `/dev/stdin`.
- **Horizon logs in the Services panel now stream the correct site** — the logs URL for a Horizon service entry now routes to `/api/horizon/{site}/logs` (systemd journal) instead of the generic `/api/logs/lerd-horizon-{site}` endpoint that tried to use `podman logs` on a non-existent container.
- **Horizon log tab on the Sites panel no longer shows stale logs from a previous site** — switching sites now properly closes and clears the Horizon log stream; clicking the Horizon tab reconnects to the correct site's stream.

---

## [1.2.2] — 2026-03-31

### Added

- **`lerd init` validates PHP version input** — the PHP version prompt now rejects invalid input such as `8,5` or plain strings; only `MAJOR.MINOR` numeric format (e.g. `8.3`) is accepted.
- **`lerd init` and `lerd env` detect services from `.env.example`** — when `.env` is absent, service detection falls back to `.env.example` so a freshly cloned project is configured correctly before `.env` is created.
- **`lerd env` waits for services to be ready before creating databases and buckets** — after starting MySQL, PostgreSQL, or RustFS, lerd now polls for readiness (`mysqladmin ping` / `pg_isready` / TCP dial) before attempting to create the database or bucket. Previously the create step could silently fail if the container had not finished initialising.
- **Automatic quadlet restoration for orphaned PHP FPM containers** — `lerd php:list` (and any command that calls `ListInstalled`) now scans `podman ps -a` for `lerd-php*-fpm` containers whose quadlet file is missing and restores it automatically, so users who lost their quadlet files do not need to reinstall PHP.

### Fixed

- **`lerd init` installs PHP FPM with a progress indicator** — when the required PHP FPM version is not yet installed, `lerd init` now shows a spinner rather than silently blocking. (PR [#34](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/34))

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **`mcp:inject` and `mcp:enable-global` fail on empty JSON config files** — `mergeMCPServersJSON` now skips `json.Unmarshal` when the target file exists but is empty, preventing a spurious "unexpected end of JSON input" error. Affects `~/.ai/mcp/mcp.json`, `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json`, and `.mcp.json`. (PR [#31](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/31))
- **`lerd new` runs `composer install` with the wrong PHP version** — `composer create-project` for Laravel now passes `--no-install --no-plugins --no-scripts` so dependency installation is deferred to `lerd setup`, where the correct PHP version is already active. (PR [#28](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/28) by @voronkovich)
- **Duplicate `export PATH` entries written to `.zshrc` on repeated `lerd install`** — `appendShellRC` now checks whether the PATH line already exists before appending. (PR [#30](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/30) by @voronkovich)
- **Redundant `appendShellRC` call writes a broken `export PATH=":$PATH"` line to `.zshrc`** — the call with an empty `binDir` has been removed; `ensureZshFpath` already handles the fpath setup. (PR [#29](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/29) by @voronkovich)

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **`lerd init`** — interactive wizard that writes PHP version, HTTPS preference, and required services to `.lerd.yaml` for project portability. On a machine with an existing `.lerd.yaml`, `lerd init` applies the saved config non-interactively, making new-machine setup a single command. `lerd setup` now runs the wizard as its first step, `lerd link` auto-secures when `secured: true` is set, and `lerd env` / `lerd isolate` / `lerd secure` all keep the file in sync.
- **`lerd console`** — run a framework's interactive console (e.g. `php artisan tinker` for Laravel, or the `console` field from the framework YAML) inside the project container. Arguments are forwarded as-is.
- **`console` MCP tool** — execute framework console commands from an AI assistant session. Resolves the correct binary via `config.GetConsoleCommand` so it works for any framework that defines a `console` field.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel backend for `lerd share`** — pass `--cloudflare` to tunnel a site via `cloudflared`. Without the flag, lerd auto-detects between ngrok and Expose as before. The tunnel is routed through the host proxy to fix Host header and TLS SNI for secured sites.
- **pcov bundled in PHP-FPM images** — pcov is now pre-installed via PECL in all lerd PHP-FPM images; `lerd php:ext add pcov` is no longer needed to run `pest --coverage`.
- **WebP support in PHP-FPM images** — gd and imagick now include WebP support out of the box (PR [#15](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/15) by @ReyArlena).
- **Connection URLs and hostname note in the dashboard** — database service cards now show ready-to-use connection URLs alongside a note about the internal container hostname.

### Fixed

- **Paused site vhosts overwritten on watcher restart** — `scanWorktrees()` now skips paused sites on startup; worktree vhost generation and nginx reloads triggered by `.php-version` changes are also skipped while a site is paused (registry is still updated for when the site is unpaused).
- **`lerd console` falls back to `artisan` for Laravel** — when a Laravel project's framework YAML has no explicit `console` field, `lerd console` now correctly uses `php artisan`.

### Internal

- Unit tests for `config`, `php`, `distro`, and `envfile` packages.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **`lerd install` no longer hangs after "Adding shell PATH configuration"** — the interactive MCP registration prompt has been removed. Run `lerd mcp:enable-global` manually after install to register the MCP server.
- **Dashboard URL in install completion message** — now shows `http://lerd.localhost` instead of the raw `http://127.0.0.1:7073` address.

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **CI badge on README** — the README now shows a live CI status badge linked to the `ci.yml` workflow.

### Fixed

- **MCP registration prompt unresponsive when installing via pipe** — `lerd install` reads the "Register lerd MCP globally?" prompt answer from `/dev/tty` instead of stdin. When the installer is run via a pipe (`curl ... | sh`), stdin is the pipe and `fmt.Scan` returns immediately with no input; opening `/dev/tty` directly reads from the actual terminal regardless of how the process was started.

### Internal

- **Release workflow now gates on CI** — the `release.yml` workflow runs build, test, vet, and format checks before invoking GoReleaser. A tag push on a broken commit will now fail before any artifacts are published.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **`lerd new <name-or-path>`** — scaffold a new PHP project using the framework's `create` command. Defaults to Laravel (`composer create-project laravel/laravel`). Pass `--framework=<name>` to use any framework that defines a `create` field. Extra args can be forwarded to the scaffold command after `--`. The `project_new` MCP tool provides the same functionality for AI assistants.
- **`create` field in framework definitions** — framework YAML files now support a `create` property (e.g. `create: composer create-project symfony/skeleton`). The target directory is appended automatically by `lerd new`. The `--create` flag was also added to `lerd framework add`.
- **`project_new` MCP tool** — scaffold a new project from an AI assistant session. Accepts `path` (required), `framework` (default: `laravel`), and `args` (extra scaffold flags). Follow with `site_link` and `env_setup` to register and configure the new site.
- **`lerd mcp:enable-global`** — registers the lerd MCP server at Claude Code user scope (and Windsurf / JetBrains Junie global configs) so lerd tools are available in every AI session without per-project configuration. During `lerd install`, if Claude Code is detected and lerd is not yet registered, the installer prompts to run this automatically.
- **`site_php` MCP tool** — change the PHP version for a registered site from your AI assistant. Writes `.php-version`, updates the site registry, regenerates the nginx vhost, and reloads nginx in one call. The target FPM container must be running.
- **`site_node` MCP tool** — change the Node.js version for a registered site. Writes `.node-version` and installs the version via fnm if not already present.
- **CWD fallback for MCP path resolution** — the MCP server now falls back to the working directory Claude was opened in when `LERD_SITE_PATH` is not set. This means `path` can be omitted from `artisan`, `composer`, `env_setup`, `site_link`, `db_export`, and other tools when running in a global MCP session — just open Claude in the project directory.

### Fixed

- **`lerd setup` npm step fails without a lockfile** — the npm install step now runs `npm ci` when `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` is present, and falls back to `npm install` otherwise. Previously `npm ci` was always used, causing the step to fail on projects without a lockfile. (PR [#5](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/5) by @voronkovich)
- **Duplicate `PATH` entry on `lerd install`** — `add_to_path` in `install.sh` now checks the live `$PATH` before modifying shell rc files. If the install directory is already present, the function returns early and skips rc modification. (PR [#7](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/7) by @voronkovich)
- **zsh completions moved to XDG directory** — zsh completions are written to `~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions/_lerd` instead of `~/.zfunc/_lerd`, aligning with the XDG base directory convention. (PR [#8](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/pull/8) by @voronkovich)
- **`.php-version` changes not reflected in nginx** — writing a `.php-version` file (via `lerd isolate` or directly) updated the queue worker but left the nginx vhost pointing at the old FPM socket. The watcher daemon now detects when the resolved PHP version changes, updates the site registry, regenerates the vhost, and reloads nginx automatically (debounced to 2 seconds).
- **PHP version resolution order** — `.php-version` now takes priority over `composer.json`'s `require.php` constraint, matching the documented and intuitive precedence (explicit pin beats inferred constraint).

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **`.test` domains unavailable from PHP-FPM containers** — v1.0.3 fixed internet access by setting real upstream DNS servers (e.g. `192.168.0.x`) on the `lerd` Podman network, but this caused aardvark-dns to skip systemd-resolved, breaking `.test` resolution from inside containers. `lerd start` and `lerd install` now use pasta's built-in DNS proxy at `169.254.1.1` (read from the rootless-netns `info.json`) as the aardvark-dns upstream. This address chains through systemd-resolved, which routes `.test` queries to lerd-dns and forwards all other queries to real upstream servers — giving containers both `.test` resolution and full internet access.
- **HTTPS to `.test` sites fails from inside PHP-FPM containers (`cURL error 60`)** — PHP code making outbound HTTPS requests to local `.test` domains (e.g. Reverb broadcasting, internal API calls) received SSL certificate errors because the mkcert root CA was not trusted inside the container. The PHP-FPM image build now copies the mkcert root CA into the Alpine trust store (`update-ca-certificates`), so all `.test` HTTPS certificates are trusted. Existing images are automatically rebuilt on `lerd update`.
- **Reverb / queue / schedule workers not restarted after `php:rebuild`** — when `php:rebuild` replaced and restarted the PHP-FPM containers, workers running inside those containers via `podman exec` (Reverb, queue, schedule) were killed by the `BindsTo` systemd dependency but not brought back up automatically. `php:rebuild` now explicitly restarts all such workers after the containers are back online.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **No internet access from PHP-FPM containers** — on systems where `/etc/resolv.conf` points to a stub resolver (`127.0.0.53` via systemd-resolved), aardvark-dns could not forward external DNS queries because the stub address is only reachable on the host's loopback, not from inside the container network namespace. `lerd start` and `lerd install` now detect the real upstream DNS servers (reading `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` first) and set them on the `lerd` Podman network so aardvark-dns forwards correctly.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **RustFS replaces MinIO** — MinIO OSS is no longer maintained; lerd now ships RustFS as its built-in S3-compatible object storage service. RustFS exposes the same API and credentials (`lerd` / `lerdpassword`) so no application changes are needed. Closes [#3](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/issues/3).
- **`lerd minio:migrate`** — one-command migration from an existing MinIO installation to RustFS. Stops the MinIO container, copies data to the RustFS data directory, removes the MinIO quadlet, updates `config.yaml`, and starts RustFS. The original MinIO data directory is preserved for manual cleanup.
- **Auto-migration prompt during `lerd update`** — if a MinIO data directory is detected at update time, lerd offers to run the migration automatically before continuing.
- **`lerd.localhost` custom domain** — the Lerd dashboard is now accessible at `http://lerd.localhost` (nginx proxies the domain to the UI service). `lerd dashboard` opens the new URL. `.localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.1` natively on all modern systems with no DNS configuration.
- **Installable PWA** — the dashboard ships a web app manifest (`/manifest.webmanifest`) and SVG icons so it can be installed as a standalone app from Chrome or other PWA-capable browsers.

### Fixed

- **502 Bad Gateway on Inertia.js full-page refreshes** — nginx vhost templates now include `fastcgi_buffers 16 16k` and `fastcgi_buffer_size 32k`, preventing `upstream sent too big header` errors caused by large FastCGI response headers (common on routes with heavy session/flash data).

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **`lerd shell`** — opens an interactive `sh` session inside the project's PHP-FPM container. The PHP version is resolved the same way as every other lerd command (`.php-version`, `composer.json`, global default). The working directory is set to the site root. If the site is paused, any services referenced in `.env` are started automatically before the shell opens.
- **Shell completions auto-installed on `lerd install`** — fish completions are written to `~/.config/fish/completions/lerd.fish`; zsh completions to `~/.zfunc/_lerd` with the required `fpath` and `compinit` lines appended to `.zshrc`; bash completions to `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/lerd`.
- **Pause/unpause propagates to git worktrees** — when a site is paused, all its worktree checkouts also receive a paused nginx vhost with a **Resume** button. The button targets the parent site so clicking it unpauses both the parent and all worktrees at once. Unpausing restores all worktree vhosts and removes the paused HTML files.

### Fixed

- **`lerd park` refuses to park a framework project root** — if the target directory is itself a Laravel/framework project, lerd now prints a helpful message and suggests `lerd link` instead of silently misbehaving.
- **`lerd park` no longer registers framework subdirectories as sites** — when a project root is accidentally used as a park directory, subdirectories like `app/`, `vendor/`, and `public/` are now skipped with a warning rather than being registered as phantom sites.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Laravel Horizon support** — lerd auto-detects `laravel/horizon` in `composer.json` and provides dedicated `lerd horizon:start` / `lerd horizon:stop` commands that run `php artisan horizon` as a persistent systemd user service (`lerd-horizon-{site}`). When Horizon is detected, the **Queue** toggle in the web UI is replaced by a **Horizon** toggle, and a **Horizon** log tab appears in the site detail panel while Horizon is running. Pause/unpause correctly stops and resumes the Horizon service alongside other workers. MCP tools `horizon_start` and `horizon_stop` provide the same control to AI assistants.

- **Service dependencies (`depends_on`)** — custom services can now declare which services they depend on. Starting a service with dependencies starts those dependencies first; starting a dependency automatically starts any services that depend on it; stopping a dependency cascade-stops its dependents first. Declare via the `depends_on` YAML field, the `--depends-on` flag on `lerd service add`, or the `depends_on` parameter in the `service_add` MCP tool.

- **`lerd man` — terminal documentation browser** — browse and search the built-in docs without leaving the terminal. Opens an interactive TUI with arrow-key navigation, live filtering by title or content, and a scrollable markdown pager. Pass a page name to jump directly (e.g. `lerd man sites`). Set `GLAMOUR_STYLE=light` to override the default dark theme. Works in non-TTY mode too: `lerd man | cat` prints a table of contents and `lerd man sites | cat` prints raw markdown.

- **`lerd about`** — new command that prints the version, build info, project URL, and copyright.

- **CLI commands auto-start services on paused sites** — running `php artisan`, `composer`, `lerd db:export`, `lerd db:import`, or `lerd db:shell` in a paused site's directory automatically starts any services the site needs (MySQL, Redis, etc.) before executing. A notice is printed only when a service actually needs starting; if services are already running the command executes silently. The site stays paused — no vhost restore or worker restart.

- **`lerd pause` / `lerd unpause`** — pause a site without unlinking it. `lerd pause` stops all running workers (queue, schedule, reverb, stripe, and any custom workers), replaces the nginx vhost with a static landing page, and auto-stops any services no longer needed by other active sites. The paused state persists across `lerd start` / `lerd stop` cycles. `lerd unpause` restores the vhost, restarts any services the site's `.env` references, and resumes all workers that were running before the pause. The landing page includes a **Resume** button that calls the lerd API directly so you can unpause from the browser.

- **`lerd service pin` / `lerd service unpin`** — pin a service so it is never auto-stopped, even when no active sites reference it in their `.env`. Pinning immediately starts the service if it isn't already running. Unpin to restore normal auto-stop behaviour.

- **MCP `site_pause` / `site_unpause` tools** — AI agents can pause and resume sites directly, enabling workflows like "pause all sites except the one I'm working on".

- **MCP `service_pin` / `service_unpin` tools** — AI agents can pin services to keep them always available.

- **Extra ports on built-in services** — `lerd service expose <service> <host:container>` publishes an additional host port on any built-in service (mysql, redis, postgres, meilisearch, minio, mailpit). Mappings are persisted in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml` under `services.<name>.extra_ports` and applied on every start. The service is restarted automatically if running. Use `--remove` to delete a mapping. MCP tool `service_expose` provides the same capability.

- **Reverb nginx WebSocket proxy** — when a site uses Laravel Reverb (detected via `composer.json` or `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` in `.env`), lerd now adds a `/app` location block to the nginx vhost that proxies WebSocket upgrade requests to the Reverb server running on port 8080 inside the PHP-FPM container. The block is added automatically on `lerd link` and on `reverb:start`.
- **Framework definitions** — user-defined PHP framework YAML files at `~/.config/lerd/frameworks/<name>.yaml`. Each definition describes detection rules, the document root, env file format, per-service env detection/variable injection, and background workers. `lerd framework list/add/remove` manage definitions from the CLI.
- **Framework workers** — frameworks can define named background workers (e.g. `messenger` for Symfony, `horizon` or `pulse` for Laravel) that run as systemd user services inside the PHP-FPM container. `lerd worker start <name>` / `lerd worker stop <name>` / `lerd worker list` manage them.
- **Custom workers for Laravel** — the built-in Laravel definition now has built-in `queue`, `schedule`, and `reverb` workers. Additional workers (e.g. Horizon, Pulse) can be added via `lerd framework add laravel --from-file ...`; they are merged on top of the built-in definition.
- **Generic `lerd worker` command** — `lerd worker start/stop/list` works for any framework-defined worker. `lerd queue:start`, `lerd schedule:start`, and `lerd reverb:start` are now aliases for `lerd worker start queue/schedule/reverb` and work on any framework with those workers, not just Laravel.
- **Web UI: framework worker toggles** — custom framework workers appear as indigo toggles in the Sites panel alongside queue/schedule/reverb. Each running worker shows a log tab in the site detail drawer and an indicator dot in the site list.
- **MCP `worker_start` / `worker_stop` / `worker_list`** — start, stop, or list framework-defined workers for a site via the MCP server.
- **MCP `framework_list` / `framework_add` / `framework_remove`** — manage framework definitions from an AI assistant. `framework_add` with `name: "laravel"` adds custom workers to the built-in Laravel definition.
- **MCP `sites` now includes framework and workers** — each site entry now includes its `framework` name and a `workers` array with running status per worker.
- **Docs: `Frameworks & Workers` page** — full documentation of the YAML schema, detection rules, worker definitions, and complete Symfony and WordPress examples.
- **Web UI: docs link** — a "Docs" link in the dashboard navbar opens the documentation site.

### Changed

- **`lerd service list` uses a compact two-column format** — the `Type` column has been removed. Custom services show `[custom]` inline after their status. Inactive reason and `depends on:` info now appear as indented sub-lines, keeping the output narrow on small terminals.

- **`lerd service list` / `lerd service status` shows inactive reason** — when a service is inactive, the output now includes a short note explaining why: `(no sites using this service)` for auto-stopped services, or `(start with: lerd service start <name>)` for manually stopped ones.

- **`lerd logs` accepts a site name as target** — pass a registered site name to get logs for that site's PHP-FPM container (e.g. `lerd logs my-project`). Previously only nginx, service names, and PHP version strings were accepted.

- **`lerd unlink` auto-stops unused services** — after unlinking a site, any services that were only needed by that site are automatically stopped (respecting pin and manually-started flags).

- **`db:import` and `db:export` accept a `-d`/`--database` flag** — both commands now accept an optional `--database` / `-d` flag to target a specific database. When omitted the database name falls back to `DB_DATABASE` from the project's `.env` as before. The MCP `db_export` tool gains the same optional `database` argument.

- **`lerd secure` / `lerd unsecure` restart the Stripe listener** — if a `lerd stripe:listen` service is active when HTTPS is toggled, it is automatically restarted with the updated forwarding URL so `--forward-to` stays in sync with the site's scheme.

- **MinIO: per-site bucket created by `lerd env`** — when MinIO is detected, `lerd env` now creates a bucket named after the site handle (e.g. `my_project`), sets it to public access, and writes `AWS_BUCKET=<site>` and `AWS_URL=http://localhost:9000/<site>` into `.env`. Previously `AWS_BUCKET` was hardcoded to `lerd` and `AWS_URL` had no bucket path.

- **`reverb:start` regenerates the nginx vhost** — running `lerd reverb:start` (or toggling Reverb in the web UI) now regenerates the site's nginx config and reloads nginx, ensuring the `/app` WebSocket proxy block is added to existing sites without requiring `lerd link` to be re-run.
- **`lerd env` sets correct Reverb connection values** — `REVERB_HOST`, `REVERB_PORT`, and `REVERB_SCHEME` are now derived from the site's domain and TLS state instead of hardcoded `localhost:8080`. `VITE_REVERB_*` vars are also written to match.
- **`queue_start` / `schedule_start` / `reverb_start` are no longer Laravel-only** — these CLI commands and MCP tools now work for any framework that defines a worker with that name.
- **`lerd env` respects framework env configuration** — uses the framework's configured env file, example file, format, `url_key`, and per-service detection rules instead of hardcoded Laravel paths.
- **`lerd link` / `lerd park` detect and record the framework** — the detected framework name is stored in the site registry and shown in `lerd sites`.

### Fixed

- **`lerd php` and `lerd artisan` no longer break MCP stdio transport** — both commands now allocate a TTY (`-t`) only when stdin is a real terminal. When invoked by MCP or any other pipe-based tool, the TTY flag is omitted so stdin/stdout remain clean byte streams.

- **Reverb toggle no longer appears on projects that don't use Reverb** — the UI previously showed the Reverb toggle for all Laravel sites because the built-in worker map always included `reverb`. It now gates on `cli.SiteUsesReverb()` (checks for `laravel/reverb` in composer.json or `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` in `.env`).

### Removed

- **`internal/laravel/detector.go`** — replaced by the generic `config.DetectFramework` / `config.GetFramework` system.

---

## [0.9.1] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **MCP `service_env` tool** — returns the recommended Laravel `.env` connection variables for any service (built-in or custom) as a key/value map. Agents can call `service_env(name: "mysql")` to inspect connection settings without running `env_setup` or modifying `.env`. Works for all six built-in services and any custom service registered via `service_add`.

### Changed

- **`lerd update` does a fresh version check** — bypasses the 24-hour update cache and always fetches the latest release tag from GitHub directly. After a successful update the cache is refreshed so `lerd status` and `lerd doctor` stop showing a stale "update available" notice.
- **`lerd update` ignores git-describe suffixes** — dev/dirty builds (e.g. `v0.9.0-dirty`) are now treated as equal to the corresponding release when comparing versions, so locally-built binaries no longer trigger a spurious update prompt.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **`lerd doctor` command** — full environment diagnostic. Checks podman, systemd user session, linger, quadlet/data dir writability, config validity, DNS resolution, port 80/443/5300 conflicts, PHP-FPM image presence, and update availability. Reports OK/FAIL/WARN per check with a hint for every failure and a summary line at the end.
- **`lerd status` shows watcher and update notice** — `lerd-watcher` is now included in the status output alongside DNS, nginx, and PHP-FPM. A highlighted banner is printed when a newer version is cached.
- **Background update checker** — checks GitHub for a new release once per 24 hours; result is cached to `~/.local/share/lerd/update-check.json`. Fetches relevant CHANGELOG sections between the current and latest version. Used by `lerd status`, `lerd doctor`, the web UI, and the system tray.
- **MCP `status` tool** — returns structured JSON with DNS (ok + tld), nginx (running), PHP-FPM per version (running), and watcher (running). Recommended first call when a site isn't loading.
- **MCP `doctor` tool** — runs the full `lerd doctor` diagnostic and returns the text report. Use when the user reports setup issues or unexpected behaviour.
- **Watcher structured logging** — the watcher package now uses `slog` throughout. Set `LERD_DEBUG=1` in the environment to enable debug-level output at runtime; watcher is otherwise silent except for WARN/ERROR events.
- **Web UI: Watcher card** — the System tab now shows whether `lerd-watcher` is running. When stopped, a **Start** button appears to restart it without opening a terminal. The card also streams live watcher logs (DNS repair events, fsnotify errors, worktree timeouts) directly in the browser.
- **Web UI: grouped worker accordions** — queue workers, schedule workers, Stripe listeners, and Reverb servers are now grouped into collapsible accordions on the Services tab. Click a group header to expand it; only one group is open at a time. Mobile pill navigation is split into core services + group toggle pills with expandable sub-rows.
- **Tray: update badge** — the "Check for update..." menu item shows "⬆ Update to vX.Y.Z" when a new version is cached. Per-site workers (queue, schedule, Stripe, Reverb) are no longer listed in the tray services section.

### Changed

- **`lerd update` shows changelog and asks for confirmation** — before downloading anything, `lerd update` now fetches and prints the CHANGELOG sections for every version between the current and latest release, then prompts `Update to vX.Y.Z? [y/N]`. The update only proceeds on an explicit `y`/`yes`; pressing Enter or anything else cancels.

### Fixed

- **`lerd start` now starts `lerd-watcher`** — the watcher service was missing from the start sequence and could only be stopped by `lerd quit`, never started. `lerd start` now includes it alongside `lerd-ui`.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **413 Request Entity Too Large on file uploads** — nginx now sets `client_max_body_size 0` (unlimited) in the `http` block, applied to all vhosts. `lerd start` also rewrites `nginx.conf` on every start so future config changes take effect without running `lerd install`.
- **MCP `logs` target accepts site domains** — site names containing dots (e.g. `astrolov.com`) were incorrectly matched as PHP version strings, producing invalid container names. The PHP version check now requires the strict pattern `\d+\.\d+`.
- **MinIO `AWS_URL` set to public endpoint** — `AWS_URL` is now `http://localhost:9000` (browser-reachable) instead of `http://lerd-minio:9000` (internal container hostname). `AWS_ENDPOINT` is unchanged and remains the internal address used by PHP.
- **Services page no longer blinks** — the services list was polling every 5 seconds regardless of which tab was active, and showed a loading spinner on each poll. Polling now only runs while the services tab is visible, and the spinner only shows on the initial load.

### Added

- **DNS health watcher** — the `lerd-watcher` daemon now polls `.test` DNS resolution every 30 seconds. When resolution breaks, it waits for `lerd-dns` to be ready and re-applies the resolver configuration, replicating the repair performed by `lerd start`. Uses the configured TLD (`dns.tld` in global config, default `test`).
- **MCP `logs` target is optional** — when `target` is omitted, logs for the current site's PHP-FPM container are returned (resolved from `LERD_SITE_PATH`). Specify `target` only to view a different service or site.

### Changed

- **`make install` respects manually-stopped services** — `lerd-ui`, `lerd-watcher`, and `lerd-tray` are only restarted after install if they were already running. Services stopped via `lerd quit` are left stopped.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **MCP `service_start` / `service_stop` accept custom services** — the MCP tool schema previously restricted the `name` field to an enum of built-in services, causing AI assistants to refuse to call these tools for custom services added via `service_add`. The enum constraint has been removed; any registered service name is now valid.

### Changed

- **MCP SKILL and guidelines updated** — `soketi` removed from the built-in service list (dropped in v0.8.0); `service_start`/`service_stop` descriptions clarified to explicitly mention custom service support.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added

- **`lerd reverb:start` / `reverb:stop`** — runs the Laravel Reverb WebSocket server as a persistent systemd user service (`lerd-reverb-<site>.service`), executing `php artisan reverb:start` inside the PHP-FPM container. Survives terminal sessions and restarts on failure. Also available as `lerd reverb start` / `lerd reverb stop`.
- **`lerd schedule:start` / `schedule:stop`** — runs the Laravel task scheduler as a persistent systemd user service (`lerd-schedule-<site>.service`), executing `php artisan schedule:work`. Also available as `lerd schedule start` / `lerd schedule stop`.
- **`lerd dashboard`** — opens the Lerd dashboard (`http://127.0.0.1:7073`) in the default browser via `xdg-open`.
- **Auto-configure `REVERB_*` env vars** — `lerd env` now generates `REVERB_APP_ID`, `REVERB_APP_KEY`, `REVERB_APP_SECRET`, and `REVERB_HOST`/`PORT`/`SCHEME` values when `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` is detected, using random secure values for secrets.
- **`lerd setup` runs `storage:link`** — setup now runs `php artisan storage:link` when the site's `storage/app/public` directory is not yet symlinked.
- **`lerd setup` starts the queue worker** — setup now starts `queue:start` as a final step when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` is set in `.env` or `.env.example`.
- **Watcher triggers `queue:restart` on config changes** — the watcher daemon monitors `.env`, `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, and `.php-version` in every registered site and signals `php artisan queue:restart` when any of those files change (debounced). This ensures queue workers reload after deploys or PHP version changes.
- **`lerd start` / `stop` manage schedule and reverb** — `lerd start` and `lerd stop` now include all `lerd-schedule-*` and `lerd-reverb-*` service units in their start/stop sequences alongside queue workers and stripe listeners.
- **MCP tools for reverb, schedule, stripe** — new `reverb_start`, `reverb_stop`, `schedule_start`, `schedule_stop`, and `stripe_listen` tools exposed via the MCP server.
- **Web UI: schedule and reverb per-site** — the site detail panel shows whether the schedule worker and Reverb server are running, with start/stop buttons and live log streaming.
- **Web UI: `stripe:stop` action** — the dashboard now supports stopping a stripe listener from the site action menu (was start-only).
- **`WriteServiceIfChanged`** — internal helper that skips writing and running `daemon-reload` when a service unit's content is unchanged, preventing unnecessary Podman quadlet regeneration.
- **`QueueRestartForSite`** — internal function that signals a graceful queue worker restart via `php artisan queue:restart` inside the PHP-FPM container.

### Changed

- **Queue worker uses `Restart=always`** — the `lerd-queue-*` service unit now restarts unconditionally (was `Restart=on-failure`), matching the behaviour of schedule and reverb services.
- **`lerd.test` dashboard vhost removed** — `lerd install` no longer generates an nginx proxy vhost for `lerd.test`. The dashboard is only accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:7073`. The `lerd.test` domain is no longer reserved and may be used for a regular site.
- **Web UI queue/stripe start is non-blocking** — `queue:start` and `stripe:listen` site actions now run in a background goroutine so the HTTP response returns immediately rather than waiting for the service to start.

### Removed

- **Soketi service removed** — Soketi has been removed from Lerd's service list, config defaults, and env suggestions. Laravel Reverb (`lerd reverb:start`) is the recommended WebSocket solution.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added

- **`lerd quit` command** — fully shuts down Lerd: stops all containers and services (like `lerd stop`), then also stops the `lerd-ui` and `lerd-watcher` process units, and kills the system tray.
- **Start/Stop from the web UI** — the dashboard now has Start and Stop buttons that call `lerd start` / `lerd stop` via new `/api/lerd/start`, `/api/lerd/stop`, and `/api/lerd/quit` API endpoints. The Start button is only shown when one or more core services (DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM) are not running.
- **`lerd start` resumes stripe listeners** — `lerd-stripe-*` services are now included in the start sequence alongside queue workers and the UI service.

### Changed

- **Tray quit uses `lerd quit`** — the tray's quit action now calls the new `quit` command instead of `stop`, ensuring a full shutdown including the UI and watcher processes. The menu item is renamed from "Stop Lerd & Quit" to "Quit Lerd".
- **`lerd stop` stops all services regardless of pause state** — stop now shuts down all installed services including paused ones and stripe listeners, ensuring a clean shutdown every time.

### Fixed

- **Log panel guards** — clicking to open logs for FPM, nginx, DNS, or queue services no longer attempts to open a log stream when the service is not running.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Git worktree support** — each `git worktree` checkout automatically gets its own subdomain (`<branch>.<site>.test`) with a dedicated nginx vhost. No manual steps required.
  - The watcher daemon detects `git worktree add` / `git worktree remove` in real time via fsnotify and generates or removes vhosts accordingly. It watches `.git/` itself so it correctly re-attaches when `.git/worktrees/` is deleted (last worktree removed) and re-created (new worktree added).
  - Startup scan generates vhosts for all existing worktrees across all registered sites.
  - `EnsureWorktreeDeps` — symlinks `vendor/` and `node_modules/` from the main repo into each worktree checkout, and copies `.env` with `APP_URL` rewritten to the worktree subdomain.
  - `lerd sites` shows worktrees indented under their parent site.
  - The web UI shows worktrees in the site detail panel with clickable domain links and an open-in-browser button.
  - A git-branch icon appears on the site button in the sidebar whenever the site has active worktrees.
- **HTTPS for worktrees** — when a site is secured with `lerd secure`, all its worktrees automatically receive an SSL vhost that reuses the parent site's wildcard mkcert certificate (`*.domain.test`). No separate certificate is needed per worktree. Securing and unsecuring a site also updates `APP_URL` in each worktree's `.env`.
- **Catch-all default vhost** (`_default.conf`) — any `.test` hostname that does not match a registered site returns HTTP 444 / rejects the TLS handshake, instead of falling through to the first alphabetical vhost.
- **`stripe:listen` as a background service** — `lerd stripe:listen` now runs the Stripe CLI in a persistent systemd user service (`lerd-stripe-<site>.service`) rather than a foreground process. It survives terminal sessions and restarts on failure. `lerd stripe:listen stop` tears it down.
- **Service pause state** — `lerd service stop` now records the service as manually paused. `lerd start` and autostart on login skip paused services. `lerd stop` + `lerd start` restore the previous state: running services restart, manually stopped services stay stopped.
- **Queue worker Redis pre-flight** — `lerd queue:start` checks that `lerd-redis` is running when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` is set in `.env`, and returns a friendly error with instructions rather than failing with a cryptic DNS error from PHP.

### Fixed

- **Park watcher depth** — the filesystem watcher no longer registers projects found in subdirectories of parked directories. Only direct children of a parked directory are eligible for auto-registration.
- **Nginx reload ordering for secure/unsecure** — `lerd secure` / `lerd unsecure` (and their UI/MCP equivalents) now save the updated `secured` flag to `sites.yaml` *before* reloading nginx. Previously a failed nginx reload would leave `sites.yaml` with a stale `secured` state, causing the watcher to regenerate the wrong vhost type on restart.
- **Tray always restarts on `lerd start`** — any existing tray process is killed before relaunching, preventing duplicate tray instances after repeated `lerd start` calls.
- **FPM quadlet skip-write optimisation** — `WriteFPMQuadlet` skips writing and daemon-reloading when the quadlet content is unchanged. Unnecessary daemon-reloads caused Podman's quadlet generator to regenerate all service files, which could briefly disrupt `lerd-dns` and cause `.test` resolution failures.

---

## [0.5.16] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **PHP-FPM image build on restricted Podman** — fully qualify all base image names in the Containerfile (`docker.io/library/composer:latest`, `docker.io/library/php:X.Y-fpm-alpine`). Systems without unqualified-search registries configured in `/etc/containers/registries.conf` would fail with "short-name did not resolve to an alias".

---

## [0.5.15] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **PHP-FPM image build on Podman** — the Containerfile now declares `FROM composer:latest AS composer-bin` as an explicit stage before copying the composer binary. Podman (unlike Docker) does not auto-pull images referenced only in `COPY --from`, causing builds to fail with "no stage or image found with that name". This also affected `lerd update` and `lerd php:rebuild` in v0.5.14, leaving containers stopped if the build failed after the old image was removed.
- **Zero-downtime PHP-FPM rebuild** — `lerd php:rebuild` no longer removes the existing image before building. The running container stays up during the build; only the final `systemctl restart` causes a brief interruption. Force rebuilds now use `--no-cache` instead of `rmi -f`.
- **UI logs panel** — clicking logs for a site whose PHP-FPM container is not running now shows a clean "container is not running" message instead of the raw podman error.
- **`lerd php` / `lerd artisan`** — running these when the PHP-FPM container is stopped now returns a friendly error with the `systemctl --user start` command instead of a raw podman error.
- **`lerd update` ensures PHP-FPM is running** — after applying infrastructure changes, `lerd update` now starts any installed PHP-FPM containers that are not running. Also fixed a cosmetic bug where "skipping rebuild" was printed even when a rebuild had just run.

---

## [0.5.14] — 2026-03-20

### Added

- **`LERD_SITE_PATH` in MCP config** — `mcp:inject` now embeds the project path as `LERD_SITE_PATH` in the injected MCP server config. The MCP server reads this at startup and uses it as the default `path` for `artisan`, `composer`, `env_setup`, `db_export`, and `site_link`, so AI assistants no longer need to pass an explicit path on every call.
- **`.ai/mcp/mcp.json` injection** — `mcp:inject` now also writes into `.ai/mcp/mcp.json` (used by Windsurf and other MCP-compatible tools), in addition to `.mcp.json` and `.junie/mcp/mcp.json`.

---

## [0.5.10] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **DNS race on install/update** — `lerd install` (and by extension `lerd update`) now waits up to 15 seconds for the `lerd-dns` container to be ready before calling `ConfigureResolver()`. Previously, `resolvectl` was called immediately after the container restart, causing systemd-resolved to mark `127.0.0.1:5300` as failed and fall back to the DHCP DNS server, breaking `.test` resolution until `lerd install` was run again manually.

---

## [0.5.8] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **GoReleaser archive** — split amd64 and arm64 into separate archive definitions so `lerd-tray` (amd64-only) doesn't cause a binary count mismatch error

---

## [0.5.7] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Cross-distro tray compatibility** — the main `lerd` binary is now fully static (CGO_ENABLED=0) and carries no shared library dependencies. A separate `lerd-tray` binary (built with CGO + libappindicator3) is shipped alongside it in the release tarball. At runtime `lerd tray` execs `lerd-tray`; if the helper is absent or `libappindicator3.so.1` is missing the tray is silently skipped and everything else keeps working. Fixes startup failure on Fedora and other distros where libappindicator3 is not installed by default.

---

## [0.5.6] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Parallel build TUI** — `lerd fetch` and `lerd php:rebuild` now build PHP-FPM images in parallel with a compact spinner UI; press Ctrl+O to toggle per-job output
- **Service image pull TUI** — `lerd service start` shows a spinner while pulling the container image if it is not already present
- **Condensed uninstall output** — `lerd uninstall` uses the same spinner UI for a cleaner experience

### Changed

- **Install output** — `lerd install` uses plain sequential output with a spinner only for the slow image pull and dnsmasq build steps; interactive sudo prompts (mkcert CA, DNS sudoers) are no longer affected by raw terminal mode
- **mkcert output indented** — output from `mkcert -install` is indented to align with the surrounding install step lines
- **Spinner timer hidden when zero** — the elapsed timer is omitted from spinner rows that complete in under one second

### Fixed

- **PHP Containerfile** — removed `pdo_sqlite` and `sqlite3` from `docker-php-ext-install`; both are bundled in the PHP Alpine base image and including them caused a `Cannot find config.m4` build error

---

## [0.5.5] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`lerd php:ext add/remove/list`** — manage custom PHP extensions per version; extensions are persisted in config and included in every image rebuild
- **Expanded default FPM image** — added `bz2`, `calendar`, `dba`, `ldap`, `mysqli`, `pdo_sqlite`, `sqlite3`, `soap`, `shmop`, `sysvmsg`, `sysvsem`, `sysvshm`, `xsl` (via `docker-php-ext-install`) plus `igbinary` and `mongodb` (via PECL); the default bundle now covers ~30 extensions for Herd-parity
- **Composer extension detection** — `lerd park` / `lerd link` reads `ext-*` keys from `composer.json` and warns if any required extensions are missing from the image, with an actionable hint
- **`lerd php:ini [version]`** — opens the per-version user php.ini in `$EDITOR`; the file is mounted into the FPM container at `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/98-lerd-user.ini` and created automatically with commented examples on first use

---

## [0.5.4] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Custom services**: users can now define arbitrary OCI-based services without recompiling. Config lives at `~/.config/lerd/services/<name>.yaml`.
  - `lerd service add [file.yaml]` — add from a YAML file or inline flags (`--name`, `--image`, `--port`, `--env`, `--env-var`, `--data-dir`, `--detect-key`, `--detect-prefix`, `--init-exec`, `--init-container`, `--dashboard`, `--description`)
  - `lerd service remove <name>` — stop (if running), remove quadlet and config; data directory preserved
  - `lerd service list` — shows built-in and custom services with a `[custom]` type column
  - `lerd service start/stop` — works for custom services
  - `lerd start` / `lerd stop` — includes installed custom services
  - `lerd env` — auto-detects custom services via `env_detect`, applies `env_vars`, runs `site_init.exec`
  - `lerd status` — includes custom services in the `[Services]` section
  - Web UI services tab — shows custom services with start/stop and dashboard link
  - System tray — shows custom services (slot pool expanded from 7 to 20)
- **`{{site}}` / `{{site_testing}}` placeholders** in `env_vars` and `site_init.exec` — substituted with the project site handle at `lerd env` time
- **`site_init`** YAML block — runs a `sh -c` command inside the service container once per project when `lerd env` detects the service (for DB/collection creation, user setup, etc.)
- **`dashboard`** field on custom services and built-in service responses — shows an "Open" button in the web UI when the service is active; dashboard URLs for built-ins (Mailpit, MinIO, Meilisearch) moved from hardcoded JS to the API response
- **README simplified** — now a slim landing page pointing to the docs site; full documentation at `geodro.github.io/lerd`
- **Docs updated** — `docs/usage/services.md` extended with full custom services reference

### Fixed

- Custom service data directory is now created automatically before starting (`podman` refused to mount a non-existent host path)
- `lerd service remove` now checks unit status before stopping — skips stop if not running, and aborts removal if stop fails (prevents orphaned running containers)

---

## [0.5.3] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Tray not restarting after `lerd update`**: `lerd install` was killing the tray with `pkill` but only relaunching it when `lerd-tray.service` was enabled. If the tray was started directly (`lerd tray`), it was killed and never restarted. Now tracks whether the tray was running before the kill and relaunches it directly when systemd is not managing it.

---

## [0.5.2] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- `lerd db:create` and `lerd db:shell` were missing from the binary — `cmd/lerd/main.go` was not staged in the v0.5.1 commit

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`lerd db:create [name]`** / **`lerd db create [name]`**: creates a database and a `<name>_testing` database in one command. Name resolution: explicit argument → `DB_DATABASE` from `.env` → project name (site registry or directory). Reports "already exists" instead of failing when a database is present. Available for both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **`lerd db:shell`** / **`lerd db shell`**: opens an interactive MySQL (`mysql -uroot -plerd`) or PostgreSQL (`psql -U postgres`) shell inside the service container, connecting to the project's database automatically. Replaces the need to run `podman exec --tty lerd-mysql mysql …` manually.

### Changed

- **`lerd env` now creates a `<name>_testing` database** alongside the main project database when setting up MySQL or PostgreSQL. Both databases report "already exists" if they were previously created.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **System tray applet** (`lerd tray`): a desktop tray icon for KDE, GNOME (with AppIndicator extension), waybar, and other SNI-compatible environments. The applet detaches from the terminal automatically and polls `http://127.0.0.1:7073` every 5 seconds. Menu includes:
  - 🟢/🔴 overall running status with per-component nginx and DNS indicators
  - **Open Dashboard** — opens the web UI
  - **Start / Stop Lerd** toggle
  - **Services section** — lists all active services with 🟢/🔴 status; clicking a service starts or stops it
  - **PHP section** — lists all installed PHP versions; current global default is marked ✔; clicking switches the global default via `lerd use`
  - **Autostart at login** toggle — enables or disables `lerd-autostart.service`
  - **Check for update** — polls GitHub; if a newer version is found the item changes to "⬆ Update to vX.Y.Z" and clicking opens a terminal with a confirmation prompt before running `lerd update`
  - **Stop Lerd & Quit** — runs `lerd stop` then exits the tray
- **`--mono` flag** for `lerd tray`: defaults to `true` (white monochrome icon); pass `--mono=false` for the red colour icon
- **`lerd autostart tray enable/disable`**: registers/removes `lerd-tray.service` as a user systemd unit that starts the tray on graphical login
- **`lerd start` starts the tray**: if `lerd-tray.service` is enabled it is started via systemd; otherwise, if no tray process is already running, `lerd tray` is launched directly
- **`make build-nogui`**: headless build (`CGO_ENABLED=0 -tags nogui`) for CI or servers; `lerd tray` returns a clear error instead of failing to link

### Changed

- **Build now requires CGO and `libappindicator3`** (`libappindicator-gtk3` on Arch, `libappindicator3-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `libappindicator-gtk3-devel` on Fedora). The `make build` target sets `CGO_ENABLED=1 -tags legacy_appindicator` automatically.
- **`lerd-autostart.service`** now declares `After=graphical-session.target` so the tray (which needs a display) is available when `lerd start` runs at login.
- **Web UI update flow**: the "Update" button has been removed. When an update is available the UI now shows `vX.Y.Z available — run lerd update in a terminal`. The `/api/update` endpoint has been removed. This avoids silent failures caused by `sudo` steps in `lerd install` that require a TTY.
- **`/api/status`** now includes a `php_default` field with the global default PHP version, used by the tray to mark the active version with ✔.

---

## [0.4.3] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **DNS broken after install on Fedora (and other NM + systemd-resolved systems)**: the NetworkManager dispatcher script and `ConfigureResolver()` were calling `resolvectl domain $IFACE ~test`, which caused systemd-resolved to mark the interface as `Default Route: no`. This meant queries for anything outside `.test` (i.e. all internet DNS) had no route and were refused. Fixed by also passing `~.` as a routing domain in both places — the interface now handles `.test` specifically via lerd's dnsmasq and remains the default route for all other queries.
- **`.test` DNS fails after reboot/restart**: `lerd start` was calling `resolvectl dns` to point systemd-resolved at lerd-dns (port 5300) immediately after the container unit became active — but dnsmasq inside the container wasn't ready to accept connections yet. systemd-resolved would try port 5300, fail, mark it as a bad server, and fall back to the upstream DNS for the rest of the session. Fixed by waiting up to 10 seconds for port 5300 to accept TCP connections before calling `ConfigureResolver()`.
- **Clicking a site URL after disabling HTTPS still opened the HTTPS version**: the nginx HTTP→HTTPS redirect was a `301` (permanent), which browsers cache indefinitely. After disabling HTTPS, the browser would serve the cached redirect instead of hitting the server. Changed to `302` (temporary) so browsers always check the server, and disabling HTTPS takes effect immediately.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **`lerd setup` detects the correct asset build command from `package.json`**: instead of always suggesting `npm run build`, the setup step now reads `scripts` from `package.json` and picks the first available candidate in priority order: `build` (Vite / default), `production` (Laravel Mix), `prod`. The step label reflects the detected command (e.g. `npm run production`). If none of the candidates exist, the build step is omitted from the selector.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`lerd status` TLS certificate check**: `certExpiry` was passing raw PEM bytes directly to `x509.ParseCertificate`, which expects DER-encoded bytes. The fix decodes the PEM block first, so certificate expiry is read correctly and sites no longer show "cannot read cert" when the cert file exists and is valid.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Xdebug toggle** (`lerd xdebug on/off [version]`): enables or disables Xdebug per PHP version by rebuilding the FPM image with Xdebug installed and configured (`mode=debug`, `start_with_request=yes`, `client_host=host.containers.internal`, port 9003). The FPM container is restarted automatically. `lerd xdebug status` shows enabled/disabled for all installed versions.
- **`lerd fetch [version...]`**: pre-builds PHP FPM images for the specified versions (or all supported: 8.1–8.5) so the first `lerd use <version>` is instant. Skips versions whose images already exist.
- **`lerd db:import <file.sql>`** / **`lerd db:export [-o file]`**: import or export a SQL dump using the project's `.env` DB settings. Supports MySQL/MariaDB (`lerd-mysql`) and PostgreSQL (`lerd-postgres`). Also available as `lerd db import` / `lerd db export`.
- **`lerd share [site]`**: exposes the current site publicly via ngrok or Expose. Auto-detects which tunnel tool is installed; use `--ngrok` or `--expose` to force one. Forwards to the local nginx port with the correct `Host` header so nginx routes to the right vhost.
- **`lerd setup`**: interactive project bootstrap command — presents a checkbox list of steps (composer install, npm ci, lerd env, lerd mcp:inject, php artisan migrate, php artisan db:seed, npm run build, lerd secure, lerd open) with smart defaults based on project state. `lerd link` always runs first (mandatory, not in the list) to ensure the site is registered with the correct PHP version before any subsequent step. `--all` / `-a` runs everything without prompting (CI-friendly); `--skip-open` skips opening the browser.

### Fixed

- **PHP version detection order**: `composer.json` `require.php` now takes priority over `.php-version`, so projects declaring `"php": "^8.4"` in `composer.json` automatically use PHP 8.4 even if a stale `.php-version` file says otherwise. Explicit `.lerd.yaml` overrides still take top priority.
- **`lerd link` preserves HTTPS**: re-linking a site that was already secured now regenerates the SSL vhost (not an HTTP vhost), so `https://` continues to work after a re-link.
- **`lerd link` preserves `secured` flag**: re-linking no longer resets a secured site to `secured: false`.
- **`lerd secure` / `lerd unsecure` directory name resolution**: sites in directories with real TLDs (e.g. `astrolov.com`) are now resolved correctly by path lookup, so the commands no longer error with "site not found" when the directory name differs from the registered site name.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added

- `lerd env` command: copies `.env.example` → `.env` if missing, detects which services the project uses, applies lerd connection values, starts required services, generates `APP_KEY` if missing, and sets `APP_URL` to the registered `.test` domain
- `lerd unsecure [name]` command: removes the mkcert TLS cert and reverts the site to HTTP
- `lerd secure` and `lerd unsecure` now automatically update `APP_URL` in the project's `.env` to `https://` or `http://` respectively
- `lerd install` now installs a `/etc/sudoers.d/lerd` rule granting passwordless `resolvectl dns/domain/revert` — required for the autostart service which cannot prompt for a sudo password
- PHP FPM images now include the `gmp` extension
- **MCP server** (`lerd mcp`): JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio server exposing lerd as a Model Context Protocol tool provider for AI assistants (Claude Code, JetBrains Junie, and any MCP-compatible client). Tools: `artisan`, `sites`, `service_start`, `service_stop`, `queue_start`, `queue_stop`, `logs`
- **`lerd mcp:inject`**: writes `.mcp.json`, `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md`, and `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` into a project directory. Merges into existing `mcpServers` configs — other servers (e.g. `laravel-boost`, `herd`) are preserved unchanged
- **UI: queue worker toggle** in the Sites tab — amber toggle to start/stop the queue worker per site; spinner while toggling; error text on failure; **logs** link opens the live log drawer for that worker when running
- **UI: Unlink button** in the Sites tab — small red-bordered button that confirms, calls `POST /api/sites/{domain}/unlink`, and removes the site from the table client-side immediately
- **`lerd unlink` parked-site behaviour**: unlinking a site under a parked directory now marks it as `ignored` in the registry instead of removing it, preventing the watcher from re-registering it on next scan. Running `lerd link` in the same directory clears the flag. Non-parked sites are still removed from the registry entirely
- `GET /api/sites` filters out ignored sites so they are invisible in the UI
- `queue:start` and `queue:stop` are now also available as API actions via `POST /api/sites/{domain}/queue:start` and `POST /api/sites/{domain}/queue:stop`, enabling UI and MCP control

### Fixed

- DNS `.test` routing now works correctly after autostart: `resolvectl revert` is called before re-applying per-interface DNS settings so systemd-resolved resets the current server to `127.0.0.1:5300`; previously, resolved would mark lerd-dns as failed during boot (before it started) then fall back to the upstream DNS for all queries including `.test`, causing NXDOMAIN on every `.test` lookup
- `fnm install` no longer prints noise to the terminal when a Node version is already installed

### Changed

- `lerd start` and `lerd stop` now start/stop containers in parallel — startup is noticeably faster on multi-container setups
- `lerd start` now re-applies DNS resolver config on every invocation, ensuring `.test` routing is always correct after reboot or network changes
- `lerd park` now skips already-registered sites instead of overwriting them, preserving settings such as TLS status and custom PHP version
- `lerd install` completion message now shows both `http://lerd.test` and `http://127.0.0.1:7073` as fallback
- Composer is now stored as `composer.phar`; the `composer` shim runs it via `lerd php`
- Autostart service now declares `After=network-online.target` and runs at elevated priority (`Nice=-10`)

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- UI completely redesigned: dark theme inspired by Laravel.com with near-black background, red accents, and top navbar replacing the sidebar
- Light / Auto / Dark theme toggle added to the navbar; preference persists in localStorage

---

## [0.1.66] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd start` now detects missing PHP FPM images (e.g. after `podman rmi`) and automatically rebuilds them before starting units
- `lerd status` now reports `image missing` with a `lerd php:rebuild <version>` hint instead of just showing the container as not running

---

## [0.1.65] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- PHP 8.5 FPM image now builds successfully: `opcache` is already compiled into PHP 8.5 so `docker-php-ext-enable opcache` is now a no-op (`|| true`); `apk update` is run before `apk add` to avoid stale index warnings; `redis` falls back to building from GitHub source when PECL fails

---

## [0.1.64] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `redis` and `imagick` PHP extensions now fall back to building from GitHub source when the PECL stable release doesn't compile against the current PHP API version (e.g. PHP 8.5) — redis is required so the build fails if both methods fail; imagick remains optional

---

## [0.1.63] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `pecl install redis` is now also non-fatal during PHP FPM image builds — the `redis` extension (like `imagick`) doesn't yet compile against PHP 8.5's new API; both extensions are best-effort and the build succeeds regardless

---

## [0.1.62] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- PHP 8.5 image build no longer fails when the `imagick` PECL extension can't compile against the new PHP API — imagick is installed if available, silently skipped otherwise (redis is unaffected)

---

## [0.1.61] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Domains are now always lowercased — directory names like `MyApp` or custom `--domain MyApp.test` now consistently produce `myapp.test`

---

## [0.1.60] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- All container volume mounts now include the `:z` SELinux relabeling option — on Fedora (and other SELinux-enforcing systems) dnsmasq and nginx containers were unable to read their config files, causing DNS and nginx to fail immediately after install
- Home-directory volume mounts (nginx, PHP-FPM) use `--security-opt=label=disable` instead of `:z` to avoid recursively relabeling the user's home directory

---

## [0.1.53] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd install` now configures the system DNS resolver (writes NM dispatcher / applies `resolvectl`) only **after** `lerd-dns` is running — previously applying `resolvectl dns <iface> 127.0.0.1:5300` before the dnsmasq container started routed all DNS through a non-existent server, breaking image pulls with "no such host" / "server misbehaving"

---

## [0.1.52] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- DNS resolution on Ubuntu (systemd-resolved + NetworkManager): NM overrides global `resolved.conf` drop-ins via DBUS so the `DNS=127.0.0.1:5300` drop-in had no effect; now installs an NM dispatcher script (`/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-lerd-dns`) that calls `resolvectl dns/domain` per-interface on "up", and applies it immediately to the default interface
- Upstream DNS servers in the dnsmasq config are now detected from the running system (`/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` → `/etc/resolv.conf`, skipping loopback/stub addresses) — no hardcoded IPs
- `lerd-dns.container` now mounts `~/.local/share/lerd/dnsmasq` into the container and uses `--conf-dir` instead of embedding all options in the `Exec` line

---

## [0.1.51] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- DNS resolution now works on systems using systemd-resolved (Ubuntu, etc.) — `lerd install` detects whether systemd-resolved is the active resolver and writes `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/lerd.conf` with `DNS=127.0.0.1:5300` and `Domains=~test` instead of configuring NetworkManager's embedded dnsmasq
- `lerd status` PHP version hint no longer shows "8.5" — corrected to "8.4"

---

## [0.1.50] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` `--local` binary path is now validated before `check_prerequisites` runs — previously podman not being installed would cause `die "podman is required"` before the file-exists check, making bats test 23 fail in CI

---

## [0.1.49] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` `ask()` no longer causes CI test failures under `set -euo pipefail` when `/dev/tty` is unavailable — `read </dev/tty` now has `2>/dev/null || true` so a missing tty is silently treated as "no"

---

## [0.1.48] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- All container images now use fully qualified names (`docker.io/library/nginx:alpine`, etc.) — Ubuntu's `/etc/containers/registries.conf` has no unqualified-search registries, causing short names to fail with exit code 125
- `lerd install` now writes the `lerd.test` UI vhost **before** starting nginx so the dashboard is available on the very first start

---

## [0.1.47] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd install` now runs `podman system migrate` after installing podman on a fresh system to initialise Podman's storage before the first rootless container operation

---

## [0.1.46] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Container images are now pre-pulled before `daemon-reload` / service start so the systemd 90 s default timeout is not exceeded on a fresh install pulling large images; `TimeoutStartSec=300` added to both `lerd-nginx.container` and `lerd-dns.container` as an additional safeguard
- `lerd install` no longer prints a spurious nginx reload `[WARN]` — the separate reload step was removed; `RestartUnit` already loads the latest config

---

## [0.1.45] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` `ask()` now reads from `/dev/tty` so prompts work correctly when the script is piped to bash (`curl | bash`); a missing tty falls back gracefully
- `install.sh` now aborts with a clear error if `podman` is not found after the prerequisite install step

---

## [0.1.44] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- HTTP→HTTPS redirect in SSL vhosts changed from `301` (permanent, browser-cached) to `302` (temporary) so disabling HTTPS is not cached by the browser
- Site domain links in the dashboard now use `https://` when TLS is enabled and `http://` otherwise

---

## [0.1.43] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd install` (and `lerd update`) no longer overwrites SSL vhosts with plain HTTP configs — sites with `secured: true` in `sites.yaml` now have their SSL vhost regenerated in-place during the vhost regeneration step
- Sites table in the dashboard no longer flickers on background poll — the 5 s interval now updates existing row properties in-place instead of replacing the entire array; new/removed sites are still added/removed correctly

---

## [0.1.42] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- Sites tab now auto-refreshes every 5 seconds — PHP version, Node version, TLS status, and FPM running state stay current without a manual reload
- Install Node version UI added to the Services tab — enter a version number and click Install to run `fnm install` in the background

---

## [0.1.41] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd install` now uses `RestartUnit` (instead of `StartUnit`) for all services so a re-run after `lerd update` picks up the new binary and any changed quadlet files
- Installer bats tests updated: `latest_version` mocks updated for the redirect-based version check, `certutil` added to the `--check` prerequisite mock

---

## [0.1.40] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Sites tab now shows the live PHP/Node version detected from disk (`.php-version`, `.lerd.yaml`, `composer.json`) instead of the stale value stored in `sites.yaml`; if the detected version differs, `sites.yaml` is updated automatically

---

## [0.1.39] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- PHP and Node columns in the Sites tab are now dropdowns — selecting a version writes `.php-version` / `.node-version` to the project directory, updates `sites.yaml`, regenerates the nginx vhost, and reloads nginx; available PHP versions come from installed FPM quadlets, Node versions from `fnm list`

---

## [0.1.38] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- HTTPS sites no longer return "File not found" — `SecureSite` was constructing a bare `config.Site` with only `Domain` and `PHPVersion`, leaving `Path` empty so the generated SSL vhost had `root /public`; it now receives the full site struct
- `fetchLatestVersion` tests updated to use the redirect-based approach (fixes broken test suite after v0.1.34 change)

---

## [0.1.37] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- HTTPS toggle in Sites tab no longer returns "site not found" — the API was looking up sites by name but receiving the full domain; added `FindSiteByDomain` and switched the handler to use it
- HTTPS column now shows a proper toggle switch instead of "On / Off" text buttons

---

## [0.1.36] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd status` no longer warns about all 7 services being inactive — it now only shows services that have a quadlet file on disk (i.e. were intentionally installed); uninstalled services are silently skipped with a single "No services installed" message if none are present

---

## [0.1.35] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `install.sh` now checks for `certutil` (`nss-tools`) as a prerequisite and offers to install it automatically — without it mkcert cannot register the CA in Chrome/Firefox, causing `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` on HTTPS sites
- README documents `certutil`/`nss-tools` as a requirement with per-distro package names

---

## [0.1.34] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Version detection in both `lerd update` and `install.sh` no longer uses the GitHub REST API — it now follows the `https://github.com/{repo}/releases/latest` HTML redirect to extract the tag from the URL; this endpoint is not rate-limited (60 req/hour limit on the API was causing "No releases found" / HTTP 403 for anyone who ran the installer more than a few times)

---

## [0.1.33] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` `latest_version()` now sends `User-Agent: lerd-installer` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers — GitHub's API returns 403 for unauthenticated requests without a User-Agent, which the script was silently treating as "no releases found"
- `install.sh` `cmd_uninstall` now dynamically discovers units from quadlet files on disk (same fix as `lerd uninstall`)

---

## [0.1.32] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd uninstall` now stops and disables all services that were enabled at runtime (e.g. mailpit, soketi started from the UI dashboard) — the unit list is now derived dynamically from the quadlet files on disk instead of a hardcoded list, so nothing is left behind
- `lerd uninstall` now also removes `lerd-ui.service` alongside `lerd-watcher.service`

---

## [0.1.31] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd update` no longer fails with "GitHub API returned HTTP 403" — the version check now sends a `User-Agent: lerd-cli` header, which GitHub requires for unauthenticated API requests

---

## [0.1.30] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd update` now restarts the `lerd-ui` systemd service after applying changes so the new binary is immediately picked up without manual intervention

---

## [0.1.29] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **HTTPS toggle in Sites tab** — the TLS column is now a clickable button; clicking it calls `POST /api/sites/{domain}/secure` or `unsecure`, issues/removes the mkcert certificate, regenerates the nginx vhost, and reloads nginx inline without leaving the UI

### Fixed

- `lerd secure` no longer fails with "renaming SSL config: no such file or directory" — `RemoveVhost` was deleting both the HTTP and SSL config files before the rename; the command now only removes the HTTP config, then renames the SSL one into place
- `.env` Copy button now works on plain HTTP (`lerd.test`) — `navigator.clipboard.writeText` requires HTTPS; added a `document.execCommand('copy')` fallback via a temporary off-screen textarea

---

## [0.1.28] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Live logs drawer** — click any site row in the dashboard to open a live streaming log panel at the bottom of the screen showing that site's PHP-FPM container output (`podman logs -f`); lines are colour-coded (red for errors/fatals, yellow for warnings/notices); auto-scrolls with a 500-line buffer; Clear and Close controls in the header
- **Env vars preview in Services tab** — each service card now has a "Show .env / Hide .env" toggle that expands a syntax-highlighted code block with all the `.env` variables for that service, with a one-click Copy button in the header

### Fixed

- Service start from UI no longer fails with "Unit not found" after the first time a service quadlet is written — `handleServiceAction` now retries `StartUnit` up to 5 times with increasing delays (300 ms each) to give the systemd Quadlet generator time to register the new `.service` unit after `daemon-reload`
- Removed stale "Copied to clipboard!" feedback element that was previously separate from the env preview Copy button

---

## [0.1.27] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd update` (and `lerd install`) no longer prompts for sudo if DNS is already configured — `dns.Setup()` now checks whether `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/lerd.conf` and `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/lerd.conf` already contain the correct content and skips all sudo steps if so; this makes updating from the UI dashboard work without any password prompt in the common case

---

## [0.1.26] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd.test` proxy vhost no longer uses `resolver` + `set $upstream` — nginx's resolver directive only works with DNS, but `host.containers.internal` is resolved via `/etc/hosts` inside the container; using a static `proxy_pass http://host.containers.internal:7073` lets nginx resolve it correctly at startup

---

## [0.1.25] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- `lerd update` no longer unconditionally rebuilds PHP-FPM images — it now computes a SHA-256 hash of the embedded Containerfile and only rebuilds if the hash differs from the one stored after the last successful build
- Hash is stored to `~/.local/share/lerd/php-image-hash` after `lerd php:rebuild`, `lerd use <version>`, and `lerd park` (first build)

---

## [0.1.24] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd.test` proxy vhost now uses `host.containers.internal` instead of the Podman network gateway IP — the gateway IP is typically blocked by the host firewall for connections from containers, while `host.containers.internal` is a Podman built-in that always routes to the host correctly

---

## [0.1.23] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Dashboard service start now writes the Quadlet file and reloads systemd before calling `systemctl start`, fixing "Unit not found" error on first use
- Service action errors are now returned as JSON with the error message and last 20 lines of `journalctl` logs
- Frontend shows a loading spinner while toggling, "Started successfully" / "Stopped" flash on success, and an inline error with expandable logs on failure

---

## [0.1.22] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd.test` dashboard now reachable: UI server changed to listen on `0.0.0.0:7073` so nginx (running inside the Podman container) can reach it via the network gateway IP
- `lerd install` now reloads nginx after writing the `lerd.test` proxy vhost so it takes effect immediately without a manual restart
- `lerd.test` is now a reserved domain — `lerd park` silently skips any directory that would resolve to it, `lerd link` returns an error if the resolved domain is reserved

---

## [0.1.21] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Lerd dashboard** — browser UI available at `http://lerd.test`, served by `lerd serve-ui` as a persistent systemd user service (`lerd-ui.service`)
- Dashboard shows three tabs: **Sites** (table with domain links, PHP/Node version, TLS badge, FPM status), **Services** (start/stop toggles, copy `.env` button per service), **System** (DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM health, auto-refreshes every 10 seconds)
- **Update flow** built into the UI: "Check for update" button in sidebar checks GitHub releases; if an update is available shows the version and an "Update" button that runs `lerd update`
- `lerd install` now writes and starts `lerd-ui.service` and generates the `lerd.test` nginx reverse proxy vhost; prints `Dashboard: http://lerd.test` on completion
- `lerd start` / `lerd stop` include `lerd-ui` alongside DNS, nginx, and PHP-FPM

---

## [0.1.20] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- `lerd stop` now also stops all installed services (those with a quadlet file) in addition to DNS, nginx, and PHP-FPM
- `lerd start` now also starts all installed services

---

## [0.1.19] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd php:rebuild` — force-removes and rebuilds all installed PHP-FPM images; useful after a Containerfile change
- `lerd update` now automatically runs `lerd php:rebuild` after `lerd install` so PHP-FPM image changes (new extensions, config tweaks) are applied on every update

---

## [0.1.18] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd logs` — show PHP-FPM container logs for the current project (auto-detects version)
- `lerd logs -f` / `--follow` — tail logs in real time
- `lerd logs nginx` — show nginx container logs
- `lerd logs <service>` — show logs for any service (e.g. `lerd logs mailpit`)
- `lerd logs <version>` — show logs for a specific PHP-FPM container (e.g. `lerd logs 8.5`)
- PHP-FPM containers now route all PHP errors to stderr (`catch_workers_output`, `log_errors`, `error_log=/proc/self/fd/2`) so they appear in `podman logs` / `lerd logs`

---

## [0.1.17] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `mailpit` service — local SMTP server with web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`; catches all outgoing mail from Laravel apps
- `soketi` service — self-hosted Pusher-compatible WebSocket server for Laravel Echo / broadcasting
- PHP 8.5 support — `lerd use 8.5` builds and starts the PHP 8.5 FPM container; default PHP version updated to 8.5

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd php [args...]` — runs PHP inside the correct versioned FPM container, detecting version from `.php-version` / `composer.json` / global default
- `lerd artisan [args...]` — shortcut for `lerd php artisan [args]`
- `lerd node [args...]` — runs Node via fnm with auto-detected version
- `lerd npm [args...]` — runs npm via fnm with auto-detected version
- `lerd npx [args...]` — runs npx via fnm with auto-detected version
- `lerd install` now writes `php`, `composer`, `node`, `npm`, `npx` shims to `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/` so commands work directly from the terminal

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Service `.env` variables now use container hostnames (`lerd-mysql`, `lerd-redis`, etc.) instead of `127.0.0.1` — PHP-FPM runs inside the `lerd` Podman network so `127.0.0.1` resolves to the container's own loopback, not the host

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- nginx `resolver` directive added to `nginx.conf` using the Podman network gateway so upstream container hostnames are re-resolved dynamically after FPM restarts (previously nginx cached the old IP and returned 502)
- `fastcgi_pass` in vhost templates now uses a `$fpm` variable to force use of the resolver
- `lerd install` now regenerates all registered site vhosts so template changes are applied immediately
- PHP-FPM containers now use a locally built image (`lerd-php{version}-fpm:local`) with all Laravel-required extensions pre-installed: `pdo_mysql`, `pdo_pgsql`, `bcmath`, `mbstring`, `xml`, `zip`, `gd`, `intl`, `opcache`, `pcntl`, `exif`, `sockets`, `redis`, `imagick`
- PHP-FPM images are built automatically on first `lerd use <version>` — subsequent runs reuse the cached image

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- `lerd service start` / `lerd service restart` — `.env` output is printed without leading whitespace for direct copy-paste

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd service start <service>` — automatically writes the quadlet file and reloads systemd before starting, so services work on first use without needing a prior `lerd install`

### Changed

- `lerd service start` and `lerd service restart` now print the recommended `.env` variables to add to your Laravel project after the service starts

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd start` — start DNS, nginx, and all installed PHP-FPM containers
- `lerd stop` — stop DNS, nginx, and all installed PHP-FPM containers

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Nginx and PHP-FPM containers now mount the user's home directory so project files are accessible inside the containers
- `nginx.conf` — added `user root;` and changed pid/error_log to writable paths (`/tmp/nginx.pid`, stderr) so nginx starts correctly in rootless Podman without `UserNS=keep-id`
- PHP-FPM pool now runs workers as root (`-R` flag + `zz-lerd.conf` override) so it can read project files in the home directory
- `ensureFPMQuadlet` — always overwrites the quadlet file (previously skipped if it existed, leaving stale configs in place)
- `lerd install` — now regenerates all existing PHP-FPM quadlets so config changes are applied without manual deletion
- `EnsureNginxConfig` — always overwrites `nginx.conf` (previously skipped if file existed)

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd-dns.container` quadlet template was embedded from the wrong source directory (`internal/podman/quadlets/`) — the file still referenced `andyshinn/dnsmasq` with `Network=host`, causing the DNS container to fail with "Permission denied on port 53"; updated to the Alpine-based dnsmasq on port 5300 via published port
- `dns.Setup()` and `ensureUnprivilegedPorts()` — `sudo` subprocesses now have `Stdin/Stdout/Stderr` connected to the process terminal so password prompts display correctly instead of failing with "a terminal is required"

### Added

- `lerd unpark [directory]` — removes a parked directory and unlinks all sites registered from it

### Changed

- `lerd park` and `lerd link` — directory names with real TLDs (`.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.io`, `.ltd`, etc.) now have the TLD stripped and remaining dots replaced with dashes before appending `.test` (e.g. `admin.astrolov.com` → `admin-astrolov.test`)
- `lerd use <version>` / `lerd status` — PHP version detection now tracks FPM quadlet files instead of static CLI binaries, so `lerd use 8.4` is immediately reflected in `lerd status`

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd update` now automatically runs `lerd install` after swapping the binary, so quadlet files, DNS config, sysctl settings and any other infrastructure changes are applied without the user having to run a second command

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd-dns.container` — removed `Network=host` and `AddCapability=NET_ADMIN` which both fail under rootless Podman; container now runs dnsmasq on port 5300 via a published port (`127.0.0.1:5300:5300`)
- `lerd install` — now checks `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` and automatically sets it to 80 (with sudo) so rootless Podman can bind nginx to ports 80 and 443; also writes `/etc/sysctl.d/99-lerd-ports.conf` to persist across reboots

### Changed

- `lerd status` — every FAIL entry now shows an actionable hint (e.g. `systemctl --user start lerd-nginx`, `lerd service start mysql`, `lerd use 8.4`)

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd install` was calling `dns.WriteDnsmasqConfig` (writes only the container's local config) instead of `dns.Setup()`, which means `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/lerd.conf` and `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/lerd.conf` were never written and NetworkManager was never restarted — causing `*.test` DNS resolution to silently fail
- `dns.Setup()` now prints a clear message before invoking `sudo` so users know why a password prompt appears

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — definitively fixed the `install: cannot stat '...\033[0m...'` error by refactoring `download_binary` to accept a caller-supplied directory instead of returning a path via stdout; all output now goes directly to the terminal (stderr) and is never captured by command substitution

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — `install: cannot stat '...\033[0m...'` error: `download_binary` was called inside `$()` command substitution so its `info` output was captured into the `binary` variable along with the path; all UI output in `download_binary` now goes to stderr, leaving only the path on stdout
- `install.sh` — tar extraction errors inside `download_binary` now also go to stderr and produce a clean error message instead of polluting the captured path

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — `BASH_SOURCE[0]: unbound variable` still occurred on bash versions where `${array[0]:-default}` triggers `set -u` when the array itself is unset (not just empty); fixed by suspending `nounset` briefly with `set +u` before reading `BASH_SOURCE`

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — `BASH_SOURCE[0]: unbound variable` crash when the script is piped to bash (`curl|bash` / `wget|bash`); `BASH_SOURCE` is unset in that execution context so it now defaults to `$0`

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — replaced `[[ ... ]] && main "$@"` guard with `if/fi` so the script sources cleanly under `set -euo pipefail` (the `&&` idiom exits with code 1 when the condition is false, which `set -e` treated as fatal)
- `install.sh` — `latest_version` no longer exits non-zero when the GitHub API returns no `tag_name` (e.g. curl failure or no releases yet)

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-17

Initial release.
