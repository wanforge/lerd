# Troubleshooting

When something isn't working, start with the built-in diagnostics:

```bash
lerd doctor   # full check: podman, systemd, DNS, ports, images, config
lerd status   # quick health snapshot of all running services
```

`lerd doctor` reports OK/FAIL/WARN for each check with a hint for every failure.

## Filing a bug report

If you need help on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/geodro/lerd/issues), run:

```bash
lerd bug-report
```

This writes a single plain-text file (default: `./lerd-bug-report-<timestamp>.txt`) containing the full `lerd doctor` output, your `config.yaml` and `sites.yaml`, the state of every `lerd-*` systemd unit, recent journal and container logs for lerd's own infra units, listening sockets on the lerd ports, and a curated set of environment variables.

What gets filtered before it lands on disk:

- Site `.env` files are excluded outright.
- Home paths render as `$HOME` and the username as `$USER`.
- Site names, domains and parked-directory paths are replaced with `site-1`/`site1.<tld>`/`$PARK_1` placeholders. Pass `--show-real-names` to keep the raw values for local debugging.
- Logs are kept only for lerd's own infra (`lerd-nginx`, `lerd-ui`, `lerd-dns`, `lerd-watcher`, `lerd-tray`, etc.). Preset services (mysql, redis, meilisearch, gotenberg, …), FPM containers and per-site workers still appear in the unit-state and container tables but their logs are dropped — they were producing repetitive request-shaped noise that didn't help triage.
- Custom services and per-site custom / FrankenPHP containers are omitted entirely so the report doesn't expose user app identifiers.
- Nginx structured error lines have their `request:` / `upstream:` / `referrer:` URI fields redacted, and HTTP access lines are dropped.

Skim the file before posting (it's plain text — open it in any editor) and attach it to your GitHub issue.

Override the destination with `--output`, change how many log lines per service to include with `--log-lines`, or keep raw site names with `--show-real-names`:

```bash
lerd bug-report --output /tmp/report.txt --log-lines 500
lerd bug-report --show-real-names
```

::: details `.test` domains not resolving
First, confirm DNS is actually meant to be managed by lerd. If `lerd dns:check` reports `DNS managed externally`, you opted out of dnsmasq during install and your sites should be on `*.localhost` rather than `*.test`. See [DNS](features/dns.md) for switching modes.

Otherwise, the fastest way to find the broken rung is `lerd doctor`. The DNS section walks the chain top to bottom and surfaces exactly where it breaks, with a hint per failure:

```
[DNS]
  DNS TLD (.test)                     OK
    lerd-dns container                running
    dnsmasq config                    address=/.test/127.0.0.1, port=5300
    port 5300 listening               127.0.0.1:5300
    dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5300            127.0.0.1
    resolver hookup                   NetworkManager dispatcher: /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-lerd-dns
    interface routes .test to 5300    enp14s0
    system DNS lookup                 127.0.0.1
```

The chain in order:

| Rung | What it checks | If it fails |
|---|---|---|
| `lerd-dns container` | The dnsmasq container is running. | `lerd start` (or `podman logs lerd-dns` to see why it crashed). |
| `dnsmasq config` | `~/.local/share/lerd/dnsmasq/lerd.conf` exists with `port=5300` and `address=/.<tld>/`. | `lerd start` regenerates the config from your registered TLD. |
| `port 5300 listening` | TCP/UDP 5300 is reachable on 127.0.0.1. | Another process owns the port. Find it with `ss -tlnp sport = :5300` on Linux, or `lsof -nP -iTCP:5300 -sTCP:LISTEN` on macOS. |
| `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5300` | A direct query at port 5300 returns 127.0.0.1 for `lerd-probe.<tld>`. | dnsmasq is up but its config drifted. `systemctl --user restart lerd-dns`. |
| `resolver hookup` | The NetworkManager dispatcher script or systemd-resolved drop-in is installed. | Rerun `lerd install`. |
| `interface routes .test to 5300` | `resolvectl status` shows `127.0.0.1:5300` and `~<tld>` on the active interface. | `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`, or set the routing manually with `sudo resolvectl domain <iface> ~test ~.`. |
| `system DNS lookup` | `host lerd-probe.test` (the system resolver) returns 127.0.0.1. | The drop-in is installed but resolved isn't honouring it. Check whether cloud-init or another tool wrote a higher-priority resolver config. Common on EC2 / cloud images. With a VPN connected this rung is reported as a warning rather than a failure, see the VPN section below. |

You can also call this programmatically over MCP via the `dns_diagnose` tool, useful for AI-driven troubleshooting:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"dns_diagnose","arguments":{}}}' | lerd mcp
```

The response includes a `steps` array with a `status` (`ok` / `fail` / `warn` / `skip`) and `hint` per rung, plus a `first_failure` index so an LLM can jump straight to the broken layer.
:::

::: details DNS shows "Degraded" while connected to a VPN
VPN clients such as Cisco AnyConnect, ProtonVPN, Mullvad, and WireGuard take over the system resolver when they connect, rewriting systemd-resolved so `.test` no longer routes to lerd-dns through the normal path. lerd-dns itself keeps running and answering, so the dashboard shows a yellow **Degraded** pill rather than a red **Failed** one, and `lerd doctor` reports the `system DNS lookup` rung as a warning instead of a failure. Sites still resolve, because lerd-dns answers directly on `127.0.0.1:5300`.

The watcher subscribes to kernel rtnetlink link and address events on Linux, so it reacts to a VPN connect or disconnect within a second of the interface coming up or going down (a poll every 30 seconds covers the rare case of a missed kernel event). When the host resolver environment changes, it re-points the lerd network's aardvark-dns at the current host resolvers and reloads the network so containers pick them up with a fresh cache. This is what previously required a manual `lerd restart` after connecting the VPN before PHP could reach VPN-internal API endpoints. The re-sync briefly (about a second) interrupts DNS for lerd containers while aardvark-dns restarts.

If you want the system resolver path itself restored while the VPN is up, so the pill goes back to green, move `resolve` after `dns` in the `hosts:` line of `/etc/nsswitch.conf`:

```text
hosts: mymachines mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] files myhostname dns resolve
```

This makes glibc consult the plain `dns` module before systemd-resolved's `nss-resolve`, which the VPN client no longer shadows.

::: details Nginx not serving a site
Check that nginx and the PHP-FPM container are running, then inspect the generated vhost:

```bash
lerd status                         # check nginx and FPM are running
podman logs lerd-nginx              # nginx error log
cat ~/.local/share/lerd/nginx/conf.d/my-app.test.conf   # check generated vhost
```
:::

::: details My custom nginx directive disappeared after an update
Don't edit `~/.local/share/lerd/nginx/conf.d/*.conf` directly. Lerd regenerates those files on `lerd link`, `lerd secure`, `lerd site rebuild`, and every `lerd install` (which `lerd update` re-execs). Drop your snippet in `~/.local/share/lerd/nginx/custom.d/{domain}.conf` instead — the generated vhost ends with an `include` for that file, and lerd never writes into `custom.d/`. See [Nginx Overrides](./usage/nginx-overrides.md) for examples.
:::

::: details PHP-FPM container not running
Check the systemd unit status and logs:

```bash
systemctl --user status lerd-php84-fpm
systemctl --user start lerd-php84-fpm
podman logs lerd-php84-fpm
```

If the image is missing (e.g. after `podman rmi`):

```bash
lerd php:rebuild
```
:::

::: details `podman exec` fails with "chdir: No such file or directory"
This happens when your project is outside your home directory (e.g. `/var/www/`, `/opt/projects/`). The PHP-FPM and nginx containers only mount `$HOME` by default.

Lerd handles this automatically: when you `lerd link`, `lerd park`, or run any exec command (`lerd php`, `composer`, `laravel new`) from an outside path, lerd adds the volume mount and restarts the affected containers.

If you see this error on an older lerd version, update to the latest and re-link the site:

```bash
lerd update
lerd unlink && lerd link
```

To verify the mounts are in place:

```bash
grep Volume ~/.config/containers/systemd/lerd-nginx.container
grep Volume ~/.config/containers/systemd/lerd-php*-fpm.container
```

You should see your project path listed alongside the `%h:%h` mount.
:::

::: details Permission denied on port 80/443
Rootless Podman cannot bind to ports below 1024 by default. Allow it:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
# Make permanent:
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-lerd.conf
```

`lerd install` sets this automatically, but it may need to be re-applied after a kernel update.
:::

::: details Watcher service not running
The watcher monitors parked directories, site config files, git worktrees, and DNS health. If sites aren't being auto-registered or queue workers aren't restarting on `.env` changes:

```bash
lerd status                            # shows watcher running/stopped
systemctl --user start lerd-watcher   # start it from the terminal
# or use the Start button in the UI under System > Watcher
```

To see what the watcher is doing:

```bash
journalctl --user -u lerd-watcher -f
# or open the live log stream in the UI under System > Watcher
```

For verbose output (DEBUG level), set `LERD_DEBUG=1` in the service environment:

```bash
systemctl --user edit lerd-watcher
# Add:
# [Service]
# Environment=LERD_DEBUG=1
systemctl --user restart lerd-watcher
```
:::

::: details HTTPS certificate warning in browser
The mkcert CA must be installed in your browser's trust store. Ensure `certutil` / `nss-tools` is installed, then re-run `lerd install`:

- Arch: `sudo pacman -S nss`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libnss3-tools`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install nss-tools`

After installing the package, run `lerd install` again to register the CA.
:::

::: details PHP image build is slow on first run
lerd normally pulls a pre-built base image from ghcr.io and finishes in ~30 seconds. If you see it fall back to a local build instead, the most common cause is being logged into ghcr.io with expired or unrelated credentials; the registry rejects the authenticated request even though the image is public.

lerd handles this automatically since v1.3.4 by always pulling anonymously. If you are on an older version, running `podman logout ghcr.io` before the build will fix it.
:::

::: details Nginx fails to start (missing certificates)
`lerd start` automatically detects SSL vhosts that reference missing certificate files and repairs them before starting nginx:

- **Registered sites**: the site is switched back to HTTP and the vhost is regenerated. The registry is updated (`Secured = false`).
- **Orphan SSL vhosts**: configs left behind by unlinked sites with missing certs are removed.

Repaired items are printed as warnings during startup:

```
  WARN: missing TLS certificate for myapp.test, switched to HTTP
```

To re-enable HTTPS after the automatic repair, run `lerd secure <name>`.

If nginx still fails to start, check the logs:

```bash
journalctl --user -u lerd-nginx -n 30 --no-pager
```
:::

::: details Port conflicts on `lerd start`
`lerd start` checks for port conflicts before starting containers. If another process is already using a required port, you'll see a warning:

```
Port conflicts detected:
  WARN: port 80 (nginx HTTP) already in use, may fail to start (check: ss -tlnp sport = :80)
```

Common culprits are Apache, another nginx instance, or a previously running lerd that wasn't stopped cleanly. Find and stop the conflicting process:

```bash
# Linux
ss -tlnp sport = :80

# macOS
lsof -nP -iTCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

The exact command lerd suggests in `lerd doctor` and `lerd start` output is already platform-correct, so you can copy it from there.

`lerd doctor` also checks for port conflicts as part of its full diagnostic, and adds a dedicated **[Stopped service ports]** section that flags installed services whose host port is already bound by another process. The same warning is shown next to the inactive status pill in the web UI, so you can spot the conflict without running anything: most often this is a system-installed service (Postgres, MySQL, Redis) listening on the default port. Stop the conflicting process and the warning clears on the next snapshot refresh.
:::

::: details Workers missing after reinstall
If you ran `lerd uninstall` and then reinstalled, worker units and service quadlets are deleted during uninstall. Running `lerd start` after reinstalling automatically restores them from the `workers` list saved in each site's `.lerd.yaml`. If `.lerd.yaml` does not exist or was not committed, you will need to start workers again manually (`lerd queue:start`, etc.).

To check what was restored:
```bash
lerd status   # shows all active workers and services
```
:::

::: details Workers failing or crash-looping
Check `lerd status`, the Workers section lists all active, restarting, or failed workers. In the web UI, failing workers show a pulsing red toggle and a **!** on their log tab.

To inspect the error:

```bash
journalctl --user -u lerd-queue-my-app -f    # or lerd-horizon-my-app, lerd-schedule-my-app
```

Common causes:
- Missing Redis when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`, start it with `lerd service start redis`
- Missing dependencies after a fresh clone, run `lerd setup` to install them
- Bad `.env` values, run `lerd env` to reset service connection settings

When you unlink a site, crash-looping workers are automatically detected and stopped.
:::

::: details Error: NetworkUpdate is not supported for backend CNI: invalid argument
Your system is likely configured to use the older CNI backend, which lacks support for the requested network operation. Edit or create the Podman configuration file at `/etc/containers/containers.conf` and add or modify the `network_backend` setting to `netavark`:

```toml
[network]
network_backend = "netavark"
```

To ensure a clean switch and recreate the networks with the new backend, reset the Podman storage. **Warning**: this will wipe all existing containers, pods, and networks:

```bash
podman system reset
```
:::

::: details Error: unknown flag: --dns (during `lerd install`)
Symptom: `lerd install` aborts at the `podman network create` step with `Error: unknown flag: --dns`.

Cause: your podman is older than 4.5. The `--dns` flag on `podman network create` was added in podman 4.5 (April 2023), and lerd needs it to write upstream DNS servers into netavark's per-network JSON atomically (otherwise the post-create `network update --dns-add` path crashes on Ubuntu 24.04's netavark <1.11). Distributions that ship podman older than 4.5: Ubuntu 22.04 / Zorin 17 (3.4.4), Debian 12 (4.3.1), Debian 11 (3.0.1).

Fix: upgrade podman to 4.5 or newer. On Ubuntu 22.04 and Zorin 17 the main archive doesn't ship a new enough podman, but the [Kubic libcontainers OBS repo](https://podman.io/docs/installation#ubuntu-2204-2104-2010-2004) does (it's the path podman's own docs recommend). On Debian 12 enable bookworm-backports and run `sudo apt install -t bookworm-backports podman`. See the [requirements page](getting-started/requirements.md#podman-4-5-minimum) for the full distro/version table.
:::

::: details Error: unable to parse ip fe80::...%18 specified in AddDNSServer: invalid argument
Your host's DNS configuration includes a zoned link-local IPv6 nameserver, typically advertised by your router via SLAAC + RDNSS. The zone identifier (`%18` is a kernel interface index) is meaningless inside a container's network namespace, and netavark refuses to accept it.

Lerd 1.18+ filters these addresses automatically before handing them to podman. If you're still on 1.17 or older, upgrade with `lerd update` and rerun `lerd install`. The filter is conservative: only zoned link-local (`fe80::...%iface`) addresses are dropped; globally routable IPv6 nameservers (e.g. `2606:4700:4700::1111`) are preserved.

When filtering empties the entire DNS list, lerd falls back to pasta's standard forwarder (`169.254.1.1`), which bridges into the host's resolver and preserves `.test` routing.
:::

::: details Containers can resolve `.test` over IPv4 but not over IPv6
Lerd 1.18+ creates the lerd podman network as dual-stack (v4 + v6) and writes both A and AAAA records for `.test` domains. If you upgraded from an older version, the existing v4-only `lerd` network is migrated automatically the next time you run `lerd install`: attached containers stop, the network is recreated with the `fd00:1e7d::/64` ULA prefix, the previous DNS server list is restored, and the containers restart. Quick check:

```bash
podman network inspect lerd --format '{{.Subnets}}'
# expect both an IPv4 subnet and one starting with fd00:1e7d::
```

If the v6 subnet is missing, run `lerd install` once to migrate. To verify resolution from inside a container:

```bash
podman run --rm --network lerd alpine sh -c 'nslookup laravel.test; nslookup -type=AAAA laravel.test'
```
:::

::: details Services fail to start with "aardvark-dns failed to bind [fd00:1e7d::1]:53"

Symptom: after `lerd install`, a subset of service containers (commonly `lerd-nginx`, `lerd-postgres`, `lerd-meilisearch`) fail to start. Journal shows:

```
Error: netavark: error while applying dns entries: IO error: aardvark-dns failed to start
Error starting server failed to bind udp listener on [fd00:1e7d::1]:53:
IO error: Cannot assign requested address (os error 99)
```

Cause: the host advertises IPv6 in the kernel but has no routable v6 address on any interface — only `::1` and `fe80::` — so netavark can't hold the ULA gateway on the rootless bridge, and aardvark-dns bind fails with `EADDRNOTAVAIL`. Typical in headless QEMU/KVM VMs and networks without v6 DHCP.

Lerd 1.18+ detects this on every `lerd install` by reading `/proc/net/if_inet6` (any non-loopback, non-link-local v6 address counts as usable) and falls back to a v4-only `lerd` network. An existing dual-stack network on a v6-less host is recreated as v4-only automatically. Force it:

```bash
lerd install
# look for: "Recreated lerd network as v4-only (host has no usable IPv6)."
```

If the host later gains v6 connectivity, the next `lerd install` will recreate the network as dual-stack again.

If you'd rather skip the dual-stack code path entirely, even on a v6-capable host, opt out:

```bash
lerd install --no-ipv6
# or persistently via shell rc:
export LERD_DISABLE_IPV6=1
```

Either path writes `~/.local/share/lerd/ipv6-probe-failed-lerd`, which `EnsureNetwork` honors on every code path (initial create, migration, recreate). To re-enable dual-stack, delete that marker file and re-run `lerd install`.
:::

::: details Every DNS lookup inside a lerd container stalls ~5 seconds
Symptom: pages that hit the database or any container-to-container hostname feel slow, and `time dig <anything> @<container>` takes roughly five seconds before returning an answer. The network looks fine in `podman network inspect lerd` (both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets present), but aardvark-dns's on-disk config has the v6 gateway absent from its listen-ips line.

Cause: `podman network rm` doesn't clean up `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/networks/aardvark-dns/<name>` between rm and recreate, so a network that was originally v4-only can leave aardvark with a v4-only listen header even after the network is recreated dual-stack. The container's `/etc/resolv.conf` still lists the v6 gateway as the primary nameserver, queries to it time out (~5s), then glibc falls back to the v4 gateway.

Lerd 1.18+ detects this drift on `lerd install` (aardvark listen line is v4-only despite the network being dual-stack) and self-heals by recreating the network with the stale aardvark state wiped. If you're on an earlier 1.18 build or the heal didn't fire, force it:

```bash
lerd install
```

Manual verification:

```bash
cat "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/$(id -u)}/containers/networks/aardvark-dns/lerd" | head -1
# expect both gateways, e.g.: fd00:1e7d::1,10.89.7.1 169.254.1.1
# if only 10.89.7.1 is present, the drift fix didn't run — re-run lerd install
```
:::

::: details Podman Machine overlay-storage error (macOS)
Symptom: on macOS, `lerd start` fails and **every** container start reports a graph-driver / overlay error:

```
exit status 125: Error: getting graph driver info "<id>":
readlink /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay: invalid argument
```

Cause: the macOS host was shut down ungracefully (forced power-off, battery death, kernel panic) while the Podman Machine VM was still running. The VM's container storage is left with a stale overlay mount and corrupt container layers, so no container can start until the storage is remounted and the stale containers are rebuilt.

`lerd start` detects this and **self-heals automatically** on the first run: it restarts the Podman Machine to remount the storage, force-removes the stale `lerd-*` containers so they rebuild on fresh storage, and retries the start pass once. Your data is safe throughout: lerd bind-mounts every database and site directory to the host, not into the VM.

If the automatic recovery isn't enough (it prints guidance pointing here), recreate the VM:

```bash
lerd machine reset
```

This stops the VM, removes it, and re-initialises it. Databases and site data are preserved (they live on the host); container images are rebuilt automatically on the next `lerd start`. See [Start, Stop & Autostart → `lerd machine reset`](usage/lifecycle.md#lerd-machine-reset-macos).
